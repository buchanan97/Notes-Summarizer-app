Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 2 Preface Book Design Problem We set out to design an introductory course governed by four themes: 1. Give students a good idea of what a career in MIS looks like by doing MIS. 2. Enhance the professionalism of deliverables by teaching design and usabilit y concepts. 3. Promote creativity by assigning projects that demand it. 4. Teach students about cloud computing by having them do cloud computing. Students in an introductory Management Information Systems (MIS) course often ask what a career in MIS looks like. Lacking a clear vision, they make their own assumptions. Often they assume the career involves programming with little human interaction. That MIS is a technical field could not be further from the truth. MIS job descriptions typically require candidates t o be able to collaborate, communicate, analyze needs and gather requirements. They also list the need for excellent written and communication skills. In other words, MIS workers are constantly interacting with other people both inside and outside the organ ization. They are coming up with creative solutions to business problems. This course is designed to help students get a feel for what a career in MIS would be like. Our students report that they learn more about information systems from their internships than from their IS courses. Consequently, we designed a course that looks very much like an internship —an introduction to the field followed by a substantial project. Chapter 1 begins by introducing the information systems landscape. Here we discuss all th e usual suspects: the information systems triangle, the systems development life cycle, transaction systems (ERP, SCM, CRM), collaboration systems, and business intelligence systems. Other aspects of the landscape such as usability, outsourcing, database c oncepts and so forth are introduced throughout chapter in Chapter 2 where they fit in naturally with the flow of the project. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 3 Chapter 2 is the substantial project which runs over a number of chapters. Over the course of the semester, students plan, build, and develop a proposal for an iPhone application. They develop a very realistic mockup. They also build a website to help market and support the app. Students are engaged because the project is fun and feels real. However, they are simultaneously learning business concepts and MIS skills. Prior to the existence of this course, we were only able to give such an interesting project at the senior level. Now, even as freshmen, students have a real experience of MIS in operation. A by product of creating an enga ging course is increased enrollment in the MIS major. Even students who have never heard of MIS become excited about the major and either switch majors or add it as a double major or minor. Many other books have students study tools and then do a case. By contrast, most of this book is a case. Much like the real world, we introduce tools when needed, and only to the extent needed, to get at each part of the case. Constraints The design team embraced a number of constraints in creating the book. We acknowled ged that this is a support course in terms of skills development for the other business disciplines —accounting, finance, management, and marketing. Students should walk away with skills that they can take into the other disciplines. The course requires mas tery of a number of software skills —primarily from the Microsoft Office suite. These include skills in PowerPoint, Word, and Excel. We assumed no prior background knowledge on the part of the students. Our experience is that students entering college have exposure to software skills, but not a mastery of applying those skills to solve business problems. A number of skills are also learned about cloud computing. These include Web site design and development (Google Sites, Google Gadgets, Google Docs), Color Management (Adobe Kuler Color), iPhone App mockups (MockApp), and online polls (PollEverywhere). The book was designed for both in class and online delivery and for small and large section sizes. The non - traditional student population is a growing sector a nd many of those students choose to learn online. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 4 Finally, the book needed to appeal to the business side of information systems. We accentuate the creative aspects of the field rather than casting MIS as an overly technical, nerdy, machine -oriented discip line. Values, attitude, approach We began with the assumption that MIS is an exciting discipline. Nonetheless we recognized the difficulty of conveying that excitement —especially in a skills book. However, difficult does not mean impossible — and we believe we have created an elegant solution. We hold that learning can be both challenging and fun. Research clearly shows that students want to be challenged in meaningful ways. Finally, we assumed that students recognize and want to emulate good graphic and info rmation design. This is an image - conscious generation with a keen eye for what looks cool. Why not build a book that capitalizes on the eye for graphic design that students already bring to the table? Book Design Influences While our background is in MIS, we believe that one of the strengths of the book is its ability to look outside the field for inspiration. We were influenced by a number of writers in the development of the book. Edward Tufte ( The Visual Display of Quantitative Information ) is perhaps th e world’s leading expert on the design and display of quantitative information. Tufte begins by insisting we focus first on the quality, relevance, and integrity of the content. He has an especially sensitive eye for the ethical dimension —telling the truth in an information display. Good content is followed by the creation of a good design to communicate that content. Robin Williams ( The Non -Designers Design Book ) gives simple but effective design rules that can be applied to document design, presentation d esign, website design, even spreadsheet design. Following these rules students are able to create professional displays of information. Students will use PowerPoint both in college and the workplace. Why not learn to use it effectively? Two writers were es pecially helpful in this regard. Both are pioneers in the effective construction of Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 5 PowerPoint presentations. Garr Reynolds ( Presentation Zen ) promotes a heavy use of images in PowerPoint. Nancy Duarte ( Slide:ology ), provides a comprehensive list of design guidelines. Organizing framework for the Book Our organizing framework for the book revolves around the importance of design. We want students to be creative, design like professionals, and take pride in their work. We challenge students to produce delive rables that are professional in both content and style. Problems must be thoroughly analyzed before a proper solution is designed. Information is a core asset, not only in information systems, but to most organizations. It is safe to say that most students will regularly be creating information displays as part of their jobs following graduation. Why not get a competitive advantage by learning how to create them in a professional and effective fashion? We include sections on graphic design —a subject that st udents find to be very interesting and marketable. The importance of design lead us to adopt the Systems Development Life Cycle for the assignments. In this way, students are asked to be intentional about their design choices, relating them back to the requirements that they uncovered earlier in the project. Book Guiding Principles We developed a number of guiding principles in the creation of the book. We began with creative, right brain problems. The business curriculum is so heavily focused on analysis t hat there is little room for creative expression. We have students design and draw with the software to remedy this problem. For example, students design an iPhone App in PowerPoint and simulate its operation with hyperlinks. We want to support and model c ritical thinking. There are many definitions of critical thinking and we do not claim to have the most comprehensive one. However, we believe that the explanatory framework offered by Richard Paul is especially powerful. Paul encourages faculty to communic ate concepts in four forms —definitions, rephrasing, written examples and illustrations. The hope is that one or more of the forms will stick and mutually reinforce each other in the student’s mind. Students frequently comment Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 6 that they see the value in wha t they are learning and are able to apply it not only in their other classes, but also in real life. Finally, we think that the book should support multiple learning styles. We use Neil Fleming’s taxonomy of learning styles: Visual, Auditory, Read/write, a nd Kinesthetic (VARK). Different students learn differently; this book contains something for everyone. Architecture of the Book We align the architecture of the book with our guiding principles. For example, all the book’s concepts and software skills are presented in a critical thinking format. Each concept is defined, rephrased “in other words,” bolstered by an example, and then illustrated. For software skills we repeat the same pattern in a different format. We construct a captioned screen shot. The ca ption contains the first three forms —definition, rephrasing, and written example. The screenshot contains the illustration. A great deal of work went into the digital manipulation of the screenshots to support our pedagogy. The actions are expressed with a near wordless lexicon. Symbols in the lexicon have an Anime or Comic Book feel in order to create a counterpoint and stand out from the screen shot. And frankly the Anime feel is just fun. To accommodate online learners the skills are also modeled through video lectures. Problems in the book progress from challenging students to imitate best practice to creative application of the concepts. So many times we have seen assignments where students are asked to do either too little and thus the students get lit tle value or the students are challenged but not given the proper ramp up. Our leveled approach is a good meeting in the middle —challenge with support. Since we set the bar so high for the professional quality of deliverables, we had to provide a way for students to meet that standard. What we developed is a progressively challenging pedagogy. By accomplishing the Level 1 and 2 hurdles, students prepare themselves for a comprehensive Level 3 project. Introduction: Each chapter begins with an introduction to outline the chapter. The introduction also sells the practical value of the chapter to the student’s future career. Selling the chapter achieves buy in and Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 7 creates motivation to succeed. Establishing the practical value of the chapter also lets students k now that we care about their future. Following the introduction, we present the theory behind the chapter. The theory is carefully introduced to scaffold on prior knowledge while extending that knowledge much further. We cover best practice in industry and illustrate it using good and bad examples. L1, L2, L3 Creative Application: The Level 1 and Level 2 assignments incorporate analysis and requirements stages. The Level 3 assignments focus on design. Students must analyze the problem, gather requirements, design a solution, and develop the solution. Students are encouraged to exercise creativity both in their deliverable and in their written support for the deliverable. Diagrams: We show abbreviated techniques to accomplish each of the tasks required in the assignment. Furthermore, the techniques are shown in no particular order. Students need to discover what they need to accomplish and then look up the techniques that will help to get them there. Over the years, we have learned that students can learn a te chnique very quickly, but this is not what they truly need to understand. They need to know when to apply the technique, and this pedagogy focuses on developing that intuition. Sometimes, we show before and after examples of the required deliverable. Stude nts are challenged to transform the before into the after using the techniques. We expressly avoid the step by step exercises found in many other texts. Our experience is that students will focus on keystrokes rather than concepts when presented with step by step instructions. Our model is closer to just in time learning found in many MBA programs. It is also a model for life -long learning, rather than learning specific software tools. Conclusion We have learned a lot over five years developing this book, a nd continue to learn every day as we move forward. We would like to thank our students who have helped guide us with their feedback. We will Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 8 continue to make improvements to a project that will never be entirely finished. However, this much we know —enrollm ent has dramatically increased in our department (400%).

Understand the parts of an information system 2. Identify companies tha t practice user centered design 3. Identify typical careers for information systems graduates It’s More Than Just Computers Information systems are the combination of people, information technology, and business processes to accomplish a business objective. Every information system (IS) has people, processes, and information technology. In fact, many IS professionals add most of their value working with people and processes. They manage the programmers but typically avoid programming themselves. We can represe nt an information system as a triangle with people, processes, and information technology (computers) on the three vertices. The three parts of an information system are often referred to as theinformation systems triangle. Consider the popular trend of le tting the TV audience vote on some talent shows such as Dancing with the Stars. The voting is managed by a sophisticated information system. The voters are the people involved with the system. Voters can cast the votes by phone, by text, or by online poll —three different information technologies. A central server at ABC records and tallies the votes. The business processes include the phone, texting, and online procedures —how and when to cast votes, and rules limiting the number of votes from each household . In November 2010, ABC had to defend the legitimacy of its business processes when detractors claimed that Bristol Palin, daughter of political candidate, Sarah Palin, received an inflated vote tally from Tea Party supporters. Some of these supporters bra gged on blogs about how they had circumvented the ABC Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 10 business processes to record multiple votes for Bristol. ABC claims that it has systems in place to spot and discount suspicious voting activity. They have publicly revealed some, but not all, of these fraud detection systems. At this point we don’t know for sure if fraudulent votes got through. For more on this story see for example: http://insid etv.ew.com/2010/11/19/dwts -bristol -palin -tea-party -voting -conspiracy/ . The three parts of the information systems triangle must interact in concert to realize business objectives. The job of the IS professional is to ensure that a balance is maintained and enhanced for the good of all the actors and the business as a whole. Good and Bad Information Systems Information systems professionals work with others to design and customize the systems that you interact with everyday. When you register at a hospita l, the information goes into an information system designed to support administrative reporting and insurance processing. When you buy from Amazon.com , the information goes into an information system designed t o support customer relationship management. Every information system is designed to make someone’s life easier. Unfortunately, that someone is not always the consumer. When was the last time that you had a good registration experience at a hospital? Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 11 That s ystem probably was not designed with you in mind —but rather designed to support backend reporting for the hospital administration and by proxy for the government and insurance companies. So the administrators are happy, but not the customers. From the hosp ital’s point of view there is no business need to make the registration experience extraordinarily pleasant. They are betting that you will not choose your hospital based on how difficult it was to register. Amazon.com , by contrast, delivers an extraordinary experience to its customers so that they will stay loyal. Amazon practices user centered design —designing to meet the needs of the user. However, the clever folks at Amazon also have tremendous backend repo rting. So it is possible to design systems that please customers and administrators simultaneously —but it takes a bit more effort. What would hospital systems look like if they were designed to Amazon standards? Imagine 1 -click appointments, 1 -click paymen ts, shielding the client from the insurance companies. How about an integrated patient record of all past procedures? The world will continue to gravitate toward Amazon style systems. In the end it is good business to make everyone happy —employees, custome rs, and administrators. It is also the right thing to do. Think back to the hospital. In a competitive market, maybe you would choose the better customer experience. A hospital worker might choose to work for the hospital with the more user friendly patien t information system. No one likes to be yelled at by unhappy customers. It doesn’t take much to improve the user experience (UX) of a system. You have to design a user interface (UI) anyway —why not make it a good one? In the words of Hall of Fame basketba ll coach John Wooden, “If you don’t have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it again?” Consider the tremendous success of Apple Computer. One of the main advantages that Apple has over its rivals is that it carefully analyzes how people bes t interact with technology, develops requirements based on that analysis and then designs elegant computers, the iPhone, iPad, iTunes, and so forth based on those requirements. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org Google Health, pictured here, has created a user centered patient record —and for free! It will be interesting to see if hospitals adopt it. Most Professions Use Information Systems Marketing, accounting, finance, manufacturing – there are many different professional goals and types of work in the business world. There are also ma ny different industries where this work can be performed – manufacturing, retail, banking, healthcare. No matter what your career goal is or what industry interests you, your success and the success of the business rely on your ability to recognize opportu nities where information systems can be used to improve performance. In most lines of work, you will need to store information in and retrieve information from databases. You will have to create persuasive and professional reports and presentations to conv ince others that your ideas make sense. Using Microsoft Excel and other tools, you will analyze data to find patterns and trends to aid decision -making. You will manage your relationships with contacts and clients using customer relationship management sys tems. The business’s success will depend on you leading efforts that use technology to support the introduction of new products, efficiently manage supply chains, and effectively manage complex financial activities. Retailers rely on past purchase data to develop sales forecasts and predict purchase behavior. Most businesses utilize collaboration technologies to bring together employees from all over the world to solve Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 13 problems. Your ability to recognize opportunities to use information technology to create business value is central to both your success and that of your firm. What Does an IS Career Look Like? A career in information systems is full of action, problem -solving, and teamwork. It is the goal of information systems professionals to bridge the kno wledge gap between business users and technologists, and thus IS professionals must be fluent in both worlds. Work in the field of information systems is exciting, fun, and fast -paced. There is always a new team to work with and new technology to learn abo ut, and projects move quickly leaving openings for new endeavors. In a recent report published in The Wall Street Journal, information systems professionals were tied for the highest percentage of college graduates that were satisfied with their career pat h. See http://finance.yahoo.com/college - education/article/111000/psych -majors -not-happy -with -options?mod=e du-continuing_education . When preparing to become an IS professional, students focus on learning about the types of systems that exist, what they offer to businesses, best practices for implementation, and the advantages and disadvantages of each. Student s also focus on how to work with business users and discover what their system needs are and how they can best be served by information systems. Information systems professionals focus on solving problems in businesses through the use of information system s. When students start their careers, they frequently work on teams that connect businesspersons with the appropriate system solution for their situation. Usually the organizations they work for adopt a set of best practices to create consistency across pr oject teams. Through the use of these best practices, IS professionals determine what options are available, consider the pros and cons of each, design a customized solution to match the specific business, and develop a plan on how to best implement the information system, including rollout phases and training. As mentioned, IS professionals typically work in teams. This is because the projects are usually very large and have many interworking pieces. As a result, IS professionals specialize in a particular type of work and contribute their expertise in this area. Specializations include system analysts, software developers, database administrators, and project managers. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 14 Information systems as a career is attractive to many individuals because of the traits above. However, it is also engaging because it is a career in which you get to work on making people’s lives easier. IS professionals focus on developing systems that businesspersons will use to create efficiency and increase their performance. IS professi onals design systems that help businesspersons make better decisions (decision support systems) and lead organizations (executive dashboards). Systems are also created to keep track of materials (supply chain management systems) and customers (customer rel ationship management systems). And given the important role of information in modern organizations, IS professionals record, monitor, and analyze data to learn how the business can improve (business intelligence systems). IS professionals work to design th ese systems to be more usable, more efficient, and more informative. This book will discuss these topics and allow you to experience many of them. It walks you through what it is like to be an IS professional, rather than telling you about it. K E Y T A K E A W A Y S  The information systems triangle includes people, processes, and information technology. It is a good reminder that MIS is about much more than just technology.  Well designed information systems keep the user in mind at each step of the process.  Informat ion systems are used by every functional area of business —marketing, management, finance, and accounting. For this reason it is good to have a strong background in information systems.  Careers in information systems tend to be dynamic, team based, and focu sed on problem solving.  Few information systems careers involve programming. However, IS professionals must be able to communicate with programmers. Q U E S T I ON S A N D E X E R C I S E S 1. Search for news stories on the Bristol Palin vote controversy. What systems did ABC put in place to catch voter fraud? 2. Pick a user centered web site other than Amazon.com and explain why you think it is well designed. 3. Find job descriptions for two information systems jobs. Do the job descrip tions emphasize soft skills or technical skills or both? Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 15 1.2 Designing Information Systems L E A R N I N G O B JE C T I V E S 1. Compare and contrast usability, graphic design and analytical design. 2. Outline the steps by which an information system should be designed. Many Meanings of Design The key to successful information systems is good design. But what makes a good design? A number of disciplines weigh in on this topic. We will look at design from a number of different perspectives. Whenever possible we will contrast g ood and bad designs. Different people use the word design in different contexts. When IS professionals speak of design, they are referring to business processes. Problems must be analyzed and requirements documented before solutions are designed, developed , and implemented. After all if the design does not satisfy the business need, then what’s the point? However, satisfying the business need is really a baseline standard. The vilified hospital system described earlier meets the business need of registering patients. And yet its design is in other ways lacking. Similarly, fast food meets the need for feeding one’s hunger. However, we want to be metaphorically better than fast food in our designs. Usability describes how easy the system is to navigate. The ea sier the system is to navigate, the less time a user will need to spend learning to use the system. A more usable system also leaves less room for error. Usability theory provides rules of thumb (heuristics) that document best practice conventions for designing a user interface. Amazon.com has one of the most usable online systems because they follow established conventions. Following conventions tremendously increases the potential acceptance of your website o r app. Graphic design refers to the visual appeal and organization of the user interface. There is obviously some overlap here with usability. Usable systems typically adhere to at least some graphic design rules. However, a usable system could be bland an d uninteresting. Employing graphic design principles helps ensure that the system will have visual appeal. Designs also need to fit with the overall brand of the client. Existing colors, fonts, and logos are all a part of the brand for which the system is being created. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 16 Analytical Design describes how to best represent information —especially quantitative information —to communicate clearly and truthfully. Every information systems project has quantitative dimensions associated with project management. These include estimating costs, time schedules, and so forth. The convergence of usability, graphic design, and analytical design on Yahoo Finance. This graph shows the three month stock price for Amazon vs. Google. From a usability standpoint it could not be easier to request the graph. Type the company name and it suggests the stock ticker symbol. Also, as you move your cursor (the hand), the black dot on the line moves as well, and the numbers on the top left update to display values for the date you are pas sing over —very slick! The graphic design is excellent —muting the underlying grid so that the data stands out by contrast. The analytical design is also first rate. Hundreds of data points are effortlessly represented. We see the trading volume on each day. At the bottom, the stock price is placed in context over a multi year period. In sum, we have a tremendous amount of information beautifully represented without clutter. Think about this the next time you see an impoverished PowerPoint graph with four bar s representing four data points. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 17 Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Information systems are designed using the systems development life cycle (SDLC). The SDLC is to a large extent common sense spelled out in stages. First, analyze the current situatio n. Then specify the requirements that a solution should embody. The next stage is to design a solution (no programming yet). Then the system is developed (progra
