About Introduction to Computer Science Introduction to Computer Science provides a compr ehensive foundation in cor e computer science concepts and principles, aligning with the scope and sequence of most intr oductory computer science courses. The textbook serves as an engaging entry point for students pursuing diverse fields of study and emplo yment, including computer science, business, engineering, data science, social sciences, and r elated disciplines. By addr essing a br oad learner audience—r anging fr om computer science majors to non-majors—the book offers a thor ough intr oduction to computational thinking and its applications acr oss multiple domains.Preface 1 Introduction to Computer Science is designed to be both inter active and pr actical, focusing on r eal-world applications that sho wcase ho w cor e computer science concepts can be used to solve comple x problems. Students will e xplor e foundational topics, such as algorithms, data structur es, computer systems or ganization, and softwar e de velopment, using an arr ay of engaging, hands-on activities. The te xtbook integr ates meaningful learning e xperiences thr ough chapter-based scenarios, pr oblem-solving e xercises, and pr ojectbased assessments that encour age students to apply what the y learn in authentic conte xts. Featur es such as embedded coding e xercises, industry insights, and e xplor ations of emer ging technology trends pr ovide a holistic appr oach to learning that e xtends be yond theory . With a forwar d-looking perspective, Introduction to Computer Science pr epar es students to engage with advanced topics in computer science, such as machine learning, cybersecurity , and cloud computing, ensuring the y have a solid foundation for continued study and futur e professional success. Coverage and Scope The authors and contributors consulted with other educators and industry pr ofessionals fr om a r ange of institutions and or ganizations in or der to ensur e that Introduction to Computer Science meets the diverse needs of both computer science majors and non-majors. The book is structur ed into five main parts, each focusing on critical ar eas of the discipline: •Part 1: Pr oblem Solving and Algorithms This section intr oduces students to the foundations of computer science, focusing on computational thinking, pr oblem-solving techniques, and algorithm design. T opics include data structur es, formal pr operties of algorithms, and algorithmic par adigms. Through pr actical e xamples and e xercises, students will de velop the skills needed to construct and analyze algorithms and understand their applications acr oss various domains. •Part 2: Realizations of Algorithms In this part, students e xplor e ho w algorithms ar e realized in har dwar e and softwar e, starting with lo w-level pr ogramming languages and mo ving into har dwar e design and computer systems or ganization. Students will learn about models of computation, machine-le vel representation, pr ocessor ar chitectur es, and memory hier archy. This foundational understanding enables students to see the connections between abstr act algorithms and their physical implementations. •Part 3: Designing and De veloping Softwar e Solutions This section co vers the principles of softwar e development, high-le vel pr ogramming languages, and data management. Students will learn the fundamentals of softwar e engineering and gain hands-on e xperience with both r elational and nonrelational database systems. Emphasis is placed on designing r obust softwar e solutions and managing comple x data structur es, ensuring students ar e well-pr epar ed for futur e roles in softwar e de velopment and engineering. •Part 4: Building Modern End-to-End Solutions to Business and Social Pr oblems Students apply their knowledge to design and build web and cloud-native applications. This part includes e xamples of modern web ar chitectur es, r esponsive design techniques, and cloud-based solutions using PaaS and FaaS technologies. Additionally , students will e xplor e the de velopment of hybrid multi-cloud digital solutions, providing them with e xperience in addr essing comple x business and social challenges using modern computing technologies. •Part 5: Human-Center ed Responsible Computing The final section delves into the ethical and societal implications of computing. T opics include cybersecurity , governance of cyber r esour ces, and r esponsible computing pr actices. Students will learn to navigate the comple xities of cybersecurity and go vernance while considering the br oader impacts of technology on society . Each cor e concept is designed to build on the pr evious one, ensuring a coher ent learning e xperience that provides students with a clear vie w of the field. The book’ s appr oach enables students to not only understand the principles of computer science but also see ho w the y can be applied to addr ess pr actical, r eal-world problems.2Preface Access for fr ee at openstax.or g Pedagogical Foundation and Featur es The Introduction to Computer Science textbook is designed to engage students thr ough a combination of practical, r eal-world applications and thought-pr ovoking scenarios that pr omote critical thinking and a deeper understanding of cor e concepts. The pedagogical appr oach is center ed on making computer science r elevant and accessible for students fr om diverse backgr ounds, whether the y are pursuing a degr ee in computer science or e xploring ho w computational thinking can be applied to their r espective fields. T o support this vision, the te xtbook incorpor ates se veral ke y featur es: •Concepts in Pr actice featur es pr esent ho w computer science concepts ar e applied in r eal-world conte xts by both pr ofessionals and non-pr ofessionals. Each bo x profiles personas and pr actical applications that demonstr ate ho w cor e topics, such as algorithms, data management, and softwar e engineering, ar e utilized acr oss various industries. The purpose is to inspir e students—particularly non-majors—b y showing them the value of computer science in solving e veryday challenges and to foster a gr eater appr eciation for the discipline. •Global Issues in T echnology featur es help students think globally about the societal impact of technology . These bo xes highlight ho w technology affects communities and economies ar ound the world and may intr oduce topics such as digital equity , envir onmental sustainability , and global data security . Students ar e encour aged to consider the br oader implications of technological advancements and to think critically about their potential to drive positive change or cr eate ne w challenges in global conte xts. •Industry Spotlight boxes focus on specific industry challenges and ho w technology pr ogress or application can help solve them. Industry Spotlight featur es intr oduce students to various sectors—such as healthcar e, finance, education, and law—pr oviding a glimpse into ho w computer science can drive inno vation and efficiency . By connecting theor etical concepts to industry-specific pr oblems, these featur es encour age students to e xplor e the wide-r anging applications of computer science and understand its value acr oss differ ent fields. •Link to Learning featur es pr ovide a very brief intr oduction to online r esour ces—videos, inter actives, collections, maps, and other engaging r esour ces that ar e pertinent to students’ e xplor ation of the topic at hand. •Technology in Everyday Life featur es connect computer science principles to students’ personal experiences and the world ar ound them. These bo xes explor e ho w technology intersects with daily life or current e vents, making computer science concepts mor e relatable and r elevant. Some featur es may prompt students to think cr eatively and pr opose their o wn ideas for applying computer science solutions to familiar scenarios. •Think It Thr ough scenarios pr esent students with thought-pr ovoking dilemmas or comple x problems related to the use of technology . Students ar e asked to r eflect on ethical questions, pr oblem-solving strategies, and r eal-world decision-making pr ocesses. These featur es emphasize that not all pr oblems have str aightforwar d answers and encour age students to weigh the pr os and cons of differ ent appr oaches. By navigating these scenarios, students learn to de velop judgment skills that ar e crucial in business and technology envir onments. Over all, these featur es ar e integr ated thr oughout the material to foster active learning, critical thinking, and an appr eciation for the pr actical applications of computer science. By connecting theory to pr actice and encour aging students to e xplor e real-world issues, Introduction to Computer Science provides a meaningful and supportive learning e xperience that equips students with the kno wledge and skills necessary for success in their academic and pr ofessional journe ys.
