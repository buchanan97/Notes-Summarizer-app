Information comes to you in many forms: the graphics on the front of a cereal box, or on the packaging in your cupboards; the information on the billboards and bus shelter posters you pass on your way to work; the graphics on the outside of the cup that holds your double latte; and the printed numbers on the dial of the speedometer in your car . Information is communicated by the numbers on the buttons in an elevator; on the signage hanging in stores; or on the amusing graphics on the front of your friend’ s T-shirt. So many items in your life hold an image that is created to convey information. And all of these things are designed by someone. Figur e I.2 T imes Squar e has many examples of print design Traditionally referred to as graphic design, communication design is the process by which messages and images are used to convey information to a tar geted audience. It is within this spectrum that this textbook will address the many steps of creating and then producing physical, printed, or other imaged products that people interact with on a daily basis. Design itself is only the first step. It is important when conceiving of a new design that the entire workflow through to production is taken into consideration. And while most modern graphic design is created on computers, using design software such as the Adobe suite of products, the ideas and concepts don’ t stay on the computer . To create instore signage, for instance, the ideas need to be completed in the computer software, then progress to an imaging (traditionally referred to as printing) process. This is a very wide-reaching and varied group of disciplines. By inviting a group of select experts to author the chapters of this textbook, our goal is to specifically focus on dif ferent aspects of the design process, from creation to production. Each chapter begins with a list of Learning Objectives, and concludes with Exercises and a list of Suggested Readings on the Summary page. Throughout, key terms are noted in bold and listed again in aGlossary at the end of the book. InChapter 1 , we start with some history . By examining the history of design, we are able to be inspired by, and learn from, those who have worked before us. Graphic design has a very rich and interesting heritage, with inspirations drawn from schools and movements such as the W erkbund, Bauhaus, Dada, International T ypographic Style (ITS), as well as other influences still seen in the designs of today . Figur e I.3 Johannes Itten was a designer associated with the Bauhaus school We now work in an age where the computer has had an influence on the era of Post Modernism. Is this a new age? Are we ushering in an era unseen before? Or are modern-day designs simply a retelling of the same tropes we have seen for hundreds of years? Chapter 2 follows with a discussion about the design process. Contrary to what we tend to see in popular television shows and movies where advertising executives are struck with instant, usable, and bold ideas, design strategies are seldom insights gained through such a sudden outburst of inspiration. The design process is a deliberate, constructive, and prescriptive process that is guided by specific strategies. For example, before any piece of designed communication can be started, some very detailed research needs to be performed. This happens well before any graphic design or layout software is opened on a computer . Designing is a form of problem solving, where a system is created to communicate a specificGraphic Design 2 and tar geted message. The design process is the way that a designer breaks the problem into discrete creative activities. First is an exploration of what is trying to be achieved. Facts are gathered about the problem, and the problem itself is often defined very specifically . The idea phase is where brainstorming and ideation occurs, often without judgment, as a way to gather as many dif ferent ideas and directions as possible. From this, solutions are evaluated, both for their perceived impact on the tar get audience and for their perceived ef fectiveness in portraying the desired message. Finally , all of this information is distilled into an accepted solution. Designers do not sit around waiting for ideas to just happen; they follow a process in order to make it happen. Figur e I.4 The golden ratio is a constant that appears in natur e Chapter 3 presents the most important and necessary design elements required for ef fective graphic layout and design. When designing a layout, the designer cannot just ‘throw’ all of the information onto the page. Design is a thoughtful process that makes use of many dif ferent skills to create a design that is both appealing and legible. W e discuss the grid in its many forms, including dif ferent types of grid such as the ITS grid, the golden ratio, and even strategies for using no grid at all. Space is an important design element, with dif ferent items on the page requiring more or less area to be ef fective. W e also talk about the density , or ‘colour ’ of type on the page, along with a number of dif ferent typographical conventions for making the most of the collection of words on the layout. InChapter 4 , we begin to move along in the production process and discuss some of the more physical attributes of design. And one of the most important topics in creating printed products is that of colour . It is a complex part of the design process, af fecting how an image is transmitted to the eye, how the colours are perceived, and what makes one thing look dif ferent from another , even if it is the same colour . Have you ever printed something on your home printer only to be disappointed that it doesn’ t look like it did on your computer screen? Highly detailed systems of colour management are put in place to mitigate these dif ferences. As we proceed toward creating printed output, Chapter 5 is where it all starts to come together . In the print process, this stage is called prepress. Prepress is where all the design work is translated from a file on the computer in front of you into a form that can be ‘printed’ onto a given surface. Imagine the requirements for creating not just one copy of a design, but thousands! This is a very important step, and if mistakes or production hurdles are not discovered and overcome at this step, then the project can end up being very costly for all parties involved, from the designer , to the printer , to the client. This chapter deals with topics such as preflight, imposition, separations, platemaking, and considerations for other print and finishing processes.3Graphic Communications Open Textbook Collectiv e Chapter 6 is a comprehensive look at how all of this design work will result in a finished product. The many ways that a design can be printed are varied and complex, but having some knowledge about how the print process works will help to create a more successful project. Is it going to be printed on a box, or on a billboard? How many copies are needed: one or one million? These and many more decisions influence how a product will be produced. This chapter outlines some of the more popular printing technologies, along with industry standard procedures for working with them. Suggestions for choosing the right paper (or other types of substrates ) are also made along with best practices for working with colour on the printed page. Chapter 7 rounds out this textbook with a look at online technologies and how they af fect, and are affected by , the printed word. W e examine online web-to-print solutions and their contribution to bridging the process from graphic design to printed work. W e also highlight other considerations such as branding and digital file resolution strategies. As the world has moved into an Internet-connected, always-on compendium of information, print remains a vital, relevant, and important part of the media mix. Ef fective communication campaigns make the most of allopportunities that media design and, in particular , print design can of fer. The goal of this text is to bridge the disciplines of communication design and print production to form a concise, accessible compendium outlining the design process in this modern, computer -driven age. While it is common, or perhaps easy , to surmise that graphic design is solely a computer -driven pursuit, when we take a step back, and look at the entire process, we see that computer -aided design is only one part of a lar ger picture. And by including this lar ger domain in our studies, we can truly gain an appreciation for the influences and strategies needed to be successful in this field.

The tailor , mason, cobbler , potter , brewer , and any other kind of craftsman integrated their personal design aesthetic into each stage of product development. In print, this meant that the printer designed the fonts, the page size, and the layout of the book or broadsheet; the printer chose (even at times made) the paper and ran the press and bindery . Unity of design was implicit. Typography in this pre-industrial era was predominantly used for books and broadsheets. The visual flavour of the fonts was based on the historic styles of western cultural tradition — roman, black letter , italic, and grotesque fonts were the mainstay of the industry . Typography was naturally small scale — needed only for sheets and pages — and was only lar ge when it was chiseled into buildings and monuments. Technological Shift The Industrial Revolution radically changed the structure of society , socially and economically , by moving vast numbers of the population from agrarian-based subsistence living to cities where manufacturing anchored and dominated employment and wealth. Agrarian-based society was tied to an aristocracy overseeing the land and controlling and directing production through the use of human labour . In contrast, urban production, though still very much in need of human labour (female and child labour in particular was in huge demand), was dominated by the mechanized production of goods, directed and controlled by industrialists instead of the aristocracy . The factories were powered initially by steam, and eventually by gasoline and electricity . These new manufacturing models were dominated by an engineering mentality that valued optimization of mechanical processes for high yields and introduced a compartmentalized approach to production. Design and Production Separ ate The design process was separated from the production-based process for a number of reasons. Primary was the ef ficiency-oriented mindset of the manufacturers who were focused on creating products with low unit costs and high yield outcomes, rather than on pleasing aesthetics or high-quality materials. Design process is time consuming and was considered unnecessary for each production stage of manufactured goods. Manufactured products were intended for the working and middle classes, and high-quality output was not a goal. These products were never intended to vie for the attention of the upper classes — enticing them away from the services and bespoke products of the craftsman (a contemporary example is T ip Top Tailors attracting Savile Row customers). Rather , they supplied common people with goods they had not been able to af ford before. This ef ficient line of thinking created the still existing equation of minimal design plus low material integrity equalling low-cost products. Design, rather than being a part of each step of production (implicit in the craftsman’ s approach), was added for form development and when a product needed more appeal for the masses — usually during the later stages of production through decorative additions. Design was now directed by the parameters and constraints of the manufacturing process and its needs. Adv ertising Emerges Despite low product standards, the high quantities and low costs of manufactured goods “stimulated a mass market and even greater demand” (Meggs & Purvis, 201 1, p. 127). The historic role of graphic design for broadsheets and books expanded at this point to include advertising. Each company and product needed exposure to sell these manufactured products to the mass market — no earlier method of promotion could communicate to this number of people. The design aesthetic of these times was relatively untouched by stylistic cohesion or design philosophy . Industrialists used a pastiche of historic styles that aspired to make their products look more upscale,7Chapter 1.Design History but did not go as far as to create a new visual language. This was a strategy that made sense and has since been repeated (consider early computer design aesthetics). Usually , when a new medium or communication strategy is developed (advertising in print and the posters of the Industrial Revolution), it uses visual and language styles that people are already familiar with, and introduces a new way to deliver the message. T oo much change alienates, but novelty of delivery works by adding a twist on the shoulders of an already familiar form. Font Explosion In addition to its new role in promoting products to the mass market, graphic design moved forward with an explosion of new font designs as well as new production methods. The design of fonts had earlier been linked to the pragmatic and cultural objectives of producing books and broadsheets. W ith large format posters and numerous other print components, text needed to do much more than represent a phonetic symbol. Innovations in production af fected — perhaps infected — printers with the pioneer spirit of the times, and all products and their potential were examined and re-evaluated. This attitude naturally included the function and design of fonts and the methods used to reproduce them. T ext was often the only material used to promote its subject and became integral to a visual communication. Jobbing printers who used either letterpress or lithographic presses pushed the boundaries of both, competing with each other by introducing innovations and, in turn, pushing artists and type foundries to create more products they could use. An entirely new font category , slab serif — sometimes called Egyptian — was created. Thousands of new fonts emer ged to meet the demand of the marketplace. Photogr aph y In addition to font development, the Industrial Age also contributed the photograph and ultimately its use in books and advertising. Photography (for print design) was originally used as a research tool in developing engravings, but this was costly and time consuming. Numerous inventors searched for ways to integrate photography into the press process since the early years of its development in the 1830s. Photo engraving eventually arrived in 1871 using negatives and plates. From that time forward, photography has been used to conceptually and contextually support the communication of graphic design in its many forms.Graphic Design 8 1.2 William Morris and the Arts & Cr afts Mo vement Ale x Hass Conditions and Products of the Industrial Age The Arts & Crafts movement emer ged in the second half of the 19th century in reaction to the social, moral, and aesthetic chaos created by the Industrial Revolution. W illiam Morris was its founder and leader . He abhorred the cheap and cheerful products of manufacturing, the terrible working and living conditions of the poor , and the lack of guiding moral principles of the times. Morris “called for a fitness of purpose, truth to the nature of the materials and methods of production, and individual expression by both artist and worker” (Meggs & Purvis, 201 1, p. 160). These philosophical points are still pivotal to the expression of design style and practice to this day . Design styles from the Arts & Crafts movement and on have emphasized, in varying degrees, either fitness of purpose and material integrity , or individual expression and the need for visual subjectivity . Morris based his philosophy on the writings of John Ruskin, a critic of the Industrial Age, and a man who felt that society should work toward promoting the happiness and well-being of every one of its members, by creating a union of art and labour in the service of society . Ruskin admired the medieval Gothic style for these qualities, as well as the Italian aesthetic of medieval art because of its direct and uncomplicated depiction of nature. Many artists, architects, and designers were attracted to Ruskin’ s philosophy and began to integrate components of them into their work. Morris, influenced by his upbringing in an agrarian countryside, was profoundly moved by Ruskin’ s stance on fusing work and creativity , and became determined to find a way to make it a reality for society . This path became his life’ s work. Pre-Raphealite Brotherhood Morris met Edward Burne-Jones at Exeter College when both were studying there. They both read extensively the medieval history , chronicles, and poetry available to them and wrote every day . Morris published his first volume of poetry when he was 24, and continued to write and publish for the rest of his life. After graduation, Morris and Burne-Jones tried a few occupations, and eventually decided to become artists. Both became followers of Dante Gabriel Rossetti who founded the Pre-Raphealite brotherhood that was based on many of Ruskin’ s principles. Morris did not last long as a painter , eventually finding his design vocation while creating a home for himself and his new wife (Rosetti’ s muse and model). Discovering the lack of design integrity in V ictorian home furnishings and various additional deficiencies in other aspects of home products, he chose to not only design his home, but all its furniture, tapestries, and stained glass. Morris & Co. In 1860, Morris established an interior design firm with friends based on the knowledge and experiences he had in crafting and building his home. He began transforming not only the look of home interiors but also the design studio. He brought together craftsmen of all kinds under the umbrella of his studio and began to implement Ruskin’ s philosophy of combining art and craft. In Morris’ s case, this was focused on making beautiful objects for the home. The craftsmen were encouraged to study principles of art and design, not just production, so they could reintegrate design principles into the production of their products. The objects they created were made and designed with an integrity a craftsman could feel proud of and find joy in creating, while the eventual owner would consider these products on par with works of art (an existing example is the Morris chair). The look of the work coming out of the Morris studio was based specifically on an English medieval aesthetic that the British public could connect to. The English look and its integrity of production made Morris’ s work very successful and sought after . His or ganizational innovations and principled approach gained attention with craftsmen and artisans, and became a model for a number of craft guilds and art societies, which eventually changed the British design landscape. William Morris and the K elmscott Press Morris’ s interest in writing never waned and made him acutely aware of how the book publishing industry had been negatively af fected by industrialization. One of his many pursuits included the revitalization of the book form and its design components through the establishment of the Kelmscott Press. The press was created in 1888 after Morris, inspired by a lecture about medieval manuscripts and incunabula publications, began the design of his first font, Golden, which was based on the V enetian roman face created originally by Nicolas Jenson. In his reinterpretation of this earlier font, Mor
