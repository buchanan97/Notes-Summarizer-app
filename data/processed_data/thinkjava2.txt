Contents vi CONTENTS Preface Think Javais an introduction to computer science and programming intended for readers with little or no experience. We start with the most basic concepts and are careful to define all terms when they are first used. The book presents each new idea in a logical progression. Larger topics, like control flow statements and object-oriented programming, are divided into smaller examples and introduced over the course of several chapters. This book is intentionally concise. Each chapter is 12–14 pages and covers the materialforoneweekofacollegecourse. Itisnotmeanttobeacomprehensive presentationofJava, butrather, aninitialexposuretoprogrammingconstructs and techniques. We begin with small problems and basic algorithms and work up to object-oriented design. In the vocabulary of computer science pedagogy, this book uses the “objects late” approach. The Philosophy Behind the Book Here are the guiding principles that make the book the way it is: One concept at a time:We break down topics that give beginners trouble into a series of small steps, so that they can exercise each new concept in isolation before continuing. Balance of Java and concepts:The book is not primarily about Java; it uses code examples to demonstrate computer science. Most chapters start with language features and end with concepts. viii PREFACE Conciseness:An important goal of the book is to be small enough so that students can read and understand the entire text in a one-semester college or AP course. Emphasis on vocabulary:We try to introduce the minimum number of terms and define them carefully when they are first used. We also organize them in glossaries at the end of each chapter. Program development:There are many strategies for writing programs, including bottom-up, top-down, and others. We demonstrate multiple program development techniques, allowing readers to choose methods that work best for them. Multiple learning curves:To write a program, you have to understand the algorithm, knowtheprogramminglanguage, andbeabletodebugerrors. We discuss these and other aspects throughout the book and summarize our advice in Appendix??. Object-Oriented Programming Some Java books introduce classes and objects immediately; others begin with procedural programming and transition to object-oriented more gradually. Many of Java’s object-oriented features are motivated by problems with previous languages, and their implementations are influenced by this history. Some of these features are hard to explain when people aren’t familiar with the problems they solve. We get to object-oriented programming as quickly as possible (beginning with Chapter??). But we introduce concepts one at a time, as clearly as possible, in a way that allows readers to practice each idea in isolation before moving on. So it takes some time to get there. Youcan’twriteJavaprograms(evenHelloWorld)withoutencounteringobjectoriented features. In some cases we explain a feature briefly when it first appears, and then explain it more deeply later on. If you read the entire book, you will see nearly every topic required for Java SE Programmer I certification. Supplemental lessons are available in the official Java tutorials on Oracle’s website (https://thinkjava.org/tutorial). PREFACE ix This book is also well suited to prepare high school students for the AP Computer Science A exam, which includes object-oriented design and implementation. (AP is a registered trademark of The College Board.) A mapping ofThink Javasection numbers to the AP course is available on our website: https://thinkjava.org/. Changes to the Second Edition This new edition was written over several years, with feedback from dozens of instructors and hundreds of students. A complete history of all changes is available on GitHub. Here are some of the highlights: Chapters 1–4:We reordered the material in Chapter 1 to present a more interesting balance of theory and practice. Chapters 2–3 are much cleaner now too. Methods are now presented in a single chapter, along with additional in-depth examples. Chapters 5–8:We rearranged these chapters a lot, added many examples and new figures, and removed unnecessary details. Strings are covered earlier (before arrays) so that readers can apply them to loop problems. The material on recursion is now a chapter, and we added new sections to explain binary numbers andCodingBat. Chapters 9–12:Our main goal for these chapters was to provide better explanations and more diagrams. Chapters 9–10 focus more on immutable versus mutable objects, and we added new sections on BigInteger and StringBuilder. The other content is largely the same, but it should be easier to understand now. Chapters 13–17:We balanced the amount of content in Chapters 13–14 by moving ArrayLists earlier, and we implement the “War” card game as another example. Chapters 15–17 are brand new in this edition; they cover more advanced topics including 2D arrays, graphics, exceptions, abstract classes, interfaces, and events. Appendixes:We added Appendix??to explain documentation comments and Javadoc in more detail. The other three appendixes that were present in the first edition have been revised for clarity and layout. x PREFACE About the Appendixes The chapters of this book are meant to be read in order, because each one builds on the previous one. We also include several appendixes with material that can be read at any time: Appendix A, “Tools” This appendix explains how to download and install Java so you can compileprogramsonyourcomputer. Italsoprovidesabriefintroduction to DrJava—an integrated development environment designed primarily forstudents—andotherdevelopmenttools, includingCheckstyleforcode quality and JUnit for testing. Appendix B, “Javadoc” It’s important to document your classes and methods so that other programmers (including yourself in the future) will know how to use them. This appendix explains how to read documentation, how to write documentation, and how to use the Javadoc tool. Appendix C, “Graphics” Java provides libraries for working with graphics and animation, and these topics can be engaging for students. The libraries require objectoriented features that students will not completely understand until after Chapter??, but they can be used much earlier. Appendix D, “Debugging” We provide debugging suggestions throughout the book, but this appendix provides many more suggestions on how to debug your programs. We recommend that you review this appendix frequently as you work through the book. Using the Code Examples Most of the code examples in this book are available from a Git repository athttps://github.com/ChrisMayfield/ThinkJavaCode2. Git is a “version control system” that allows you to keep track of the files that make up a project. A collection of files under Git’s control is called a “repository”. PREFACE xi GitHub is a hosting service that provides storage for Git repositories and a convenient web interface. It provides several ways to work with the code: •You can create a copy of the repository on GitHub by clicking theFork button. If you don’t already have a GitHub account, you’ll need to create one. After forking, you’ll have your own repository on GitHub that you can use to keep track of code you write. Then you can “clone” the repository, which downloads a copy of the files to your computer. •Alternatively, you could clone the original repository without forking. If you choose this option, you don’t need a GitHub account, but you won’t be able to save your changes on GitHub. •If you don’t want to use Git at all, you can download the code in a ZIP archive using theClonebutton on the GitHub page, or this link: https://thinkjava.org/code2zip. AfteryouclonetherepositoryorunziptheZIPfile, youshouldhaveadirectory namedThinkJavaCode2with a subdirectory for each chapter in the book. The examples in this book were developed and tested using OpenJDK 11. If you are using a more recent version, everything should still work. If you are using an older version, some of the examples might not. Acknowledgments Many people have sent corrections and suggestions over the years, and we appreciate their valuable feedback!

Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield xiv PREFACE Chapter 1 Computer Programming The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas—specifically, computations. Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives. And like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions. An important skill for a computer scientist isproblem solving. It involves theabilitytoformulateproblems, thinkcreativelyaboutsolutions, andexpress solutions clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program computers is an excellent opportunity to develop problem-solving skills. On one level, you will be learning to write Java programs, a useful skill by itself. But on another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer. 1.1 What Is a Computer? When people hear the wordcomputer, they often think of a desktop or a laptop. Not surprisingly, searching for “computer” on Google Images (https: //images.google.com/) displays rows and rows of these types of machines. However, in a more general sense, a computer can be any type of device that stores and processes data. 2 Chapter 1 Computer Programming Dictionary.com defines a computer as “a programmable electronic device designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations. Mainframes, desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones are some of the different types of computers.” Each type of computer has its own unique design, but internally they all share the same type ofhardware. The two most important hardware components areprocessors(or CPUs) that perform simple calculations andmemory (or RAM) that temporarily stores information. Figure 1.1 shows what these components look like. Figure 1.1: Example processor and memory hardware. Users generally see and interact with touchscreens, keyboards, and monitors, but it’s the processors and memory that perform the actual computation. Nowadays it’s fairly standard, even for a smartphone, to have at least eight processors and four gigabytes (four billion cells) of memory. 1.2 What Is Programming? Aprogramis a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation on computer hardware. The computation might be something mathematical, like solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial. It could also be a symbolic computation, like searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program. The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language: 1.3 The Hello World Program 3 input:Get data from the keyboard, a file, a sensor, or some other device. output:Display data on the screen, or send data to a file or other device. math:Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and division. decision:Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code. repetition:Perform an action repeatedly, usually with some variation. Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of small instructions that look much like these. So you can think ofprogrammingas the process of breaking down a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks. The process continues until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with the electronic circuits provided by the hardware. 1.3 The Hello World Program Traditionally, the first program you write when learning a new programming language is called the “Hello World” program. All it does is output the words Hello, World!to the screen. In Java, it looks like this: public class Hello { public static void main(String[] args) { // generate some simple output System.out.println("Hello, World!"); When this program runs, it displays the following: Hello, World! Notice that the output does not include the quotation marks. Java programs are made up ofclassandmethoddefinitions, and methods are made up ofstatements. Astatementis a line of code that performs a basic 4 Chapter 1 Computer Programming action. In the Hello World program, this line is aprint statementthat displays a message to the user: System.out.println("Hello, World!"); System.out.printlndisplays results on the screen; the nameprintlnstands for “print line”. Confusingly,printcan mean both “display on the screen” and “send to the printer”. In this book, we’ll try to say “display” when we mean output to the screen. Like most statements, the print statement ends with a semicolon (;). Java is “case-sensitive”, which means that uppercase and lowercase are not the same. In the Hello World program,Systemhas to begin with an uppercase letter;systemandSYSTEMwon’t work. Amethodis a named sequence of statements. This program defines one method namedmain: public static void main(String[] args) The name and format ofmainis special: when the program runs, it starts at the first statement inmainand ends when it finishes the last statement. Later, you will see programs that define more than one method. This program defines a class namedHello. For now, aclassis a collection of methods; we’ll have more to say about this later. You can give a class any name you like, but it is conventional to start with a capital letter. The name of the class has to match the name of the file it is in, so this class has to be in a file namedHello.java. Java uses curly braces ({and}) to group things together. InHello.java, the outermost braces contain the class definition, and the inner braces contain the method definition. The line that begins with two slashes (//) is acomment, which is a bit of English text that explains the code. When Java sees//, it ignores everything from there until the end of the line. Comments have no effect on the execution oftheprogram, buttheymakeiteasierforotherprogrammers(andyourfuture self) to understand what you meant to do. 1.4 Compiling Java Programs 5 1.4 Compiling Java Programs TheprogramminglanguageyouwilllearninthisbookisJava, whichisahighlevel language. Other high-level languages you may have heard of include Python, C and C++, PHP, Ruby, and JavaScript. Before they can run, programs in high-level languages have to be translated into alow-level language, also called “machine language”. This translation takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. But high-level languages have two major advantages: •It ismucheasier to program in a high-level language. Programs take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. •High-level languages areportable, meaning they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer. Two kinds of programs translate high-level languages into low-level languages: interpreters and compilers. Aninterpreterreads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations. Figure 1.2 shows the structure of an interpreter. Figure 1.2: How interpreted languages are executed. In contrast, acompilerreads the entire program and translates it completely beforetheprogramstartsrunning. Thehigh-levelprogramiscalledthesource code. The translated program is called theobject code, or theexecutable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation of the source code. As a result, compiled programs often run faster than interpreted programs. Note that object code, as a low-level language, is not portable. You cannot run an executable compiled for a Windows laptop on an Android phone, for 6 Chapter 1 Computer Programming example. Torunaprogramondifferenttypesofmachines, itmustbecompiled multiple times. It can be difficult to write source code that compiles and runs correctly on different types of machines. To address this issue, Java isbothcompiled and interpreted. Instead of translating source code directly into an executable, the Java compiler generates code for avirtual machine. This “imaginary” machine has the functionality common to desktops, laptops, tablets, phones, etc. Its language, called Java byte code, looks like object code and is easy and fast to interpret. Asaresult,it’spossibletocompileaJavaprogramononemachine,transferthe byte code to another machine, and run the byte code on that other machine. Figure 1.3 shows the steps of the development process. The Java compiler is a program namedjavac. It translates.javafiles into.classfiles that store the resulting byte code. The Java interpreter is another program, namedjava, which is short for “Java Virtual Machine” (JVM). Figure 1.3: The process of compiling and running a Java program. The programmer writes source code in the fileHello.javaand usesjavacto compile it. If there are no errors, the compiler saves the byte code in the file Hello.class. To run the program, the programmer usesjavato interpret the byte code. The result of the program is then displayed on the screen. Although it might seem complicated, these steps are automated for you in most development environments. Usually, you only have to press a button or type a single command to compile and interpret your program. On the other hand, it is important to know what steps are happening in the background, so if something goes wrong you can figure out what it is. 1.5 Displaying Two Messages You can put as many statements as you like in themainmethod. For example, to display more than one line of output: 1.6 Formatting Source Code 7 public class Hello2 { public static void main(String[] args) { // generate some simple output System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // first line System.out.println("How are you?"); // another line As this example also shows, you can put comments at the end of a line as well as on lines all by themselves. Phrases that appear in quotation marks are calledstrings, because they contain a sequence of characters strung together in memory. Characters can be letters, numbers, punctuation marks, symbols, spaces, tabs, etc. System.out.printlnappends a special character, called anewline, that moves to the beginning of the next line. If you don’t want a newline at the end, you can useprintinstead ofprintln: public class Goodbye { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.print("Goodbye, "); System.out.println("cruel world"); In this example, the first statement does not add a newline, so the output appears on a single line: Goodbye, cruel world Notice that there is a space at the end of the first string, which appears in the output just before the wordcruel. 1.6 Formatting Source Code In Java source code, some spaces are required. For example, you need at least one space between words, so this program is not legal: 8 Chapter 1 Computer Programming publicclassGoodbye{ publicstaticvoidmain(String[] args) { System.out.print("Goodbye, "); System.out.println("cruel world"); But most other spaces are optional. For example, this programislegal: public class Goodbye { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.print("Goodbye, "); System.out.println("cruel world"); The newlines are optional, too. So we could just write this: public class Goodbye { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.print("Goodbye, "); System.out.println ("cruel world");}} It still works, but the program is getting harder and harder to read. Newlines andspacesareimportantforvisuallyorganizingyourprogram,makingiteasier to understand the program and find errors when they occur. Many editors will automatically format source code with consistent indenting and line breaks. For example, in DrJava (see Appendix??) you can indent your code by selecting all text (Ctrl+A) and pressing theTabkey. Organizations that do a lot of software development usually have strict guidelines on how to format source code. For example, Google publishes its Java coding standards for use in open source projects:https://google.github. io/styleguide/javaguide.html. You probably won’t understand these guidelines now, because they refer to language features you haven’t yet seen. But you might want to refer to them periodically as you read this book. 1.7 Using Escape Sequences 9 1.7 Using Escape Sequences It’s possible to display multiple lines of output with only one line of code. You just have to tell Java where to put the line breaks: public class Hello3 { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.print("Hello!\nHow are you doing?\n"); The output is two lines, each ending with a newline character: Hello! How are you doing? Each\nis anescape sequence, or two characters of source code that represent a single character. (The backslash allows you toescapethe string to write special characters.) Notice there is no space between\nandHow. If you add a space there, there will be a space at the beginning of the second line. \nnewline \t tab \"double quote \\backslash Table 1.1: Common escape sequences Java has a total of eight escape sequences, and the four most commonly used ones are listed in Table 1.1. For example, to write quotation marks inside of strings, you need to escape them with a backslash: System.out.println("She said \"Hello!\" to me."); The result is as follows: She said "Hello!" to me. 10 Chapter 1 Computer Programming 1.8 What Is Computer Science? This book intentionally omits some details about the Java language (such as the other escape sequences), because our main goal is teaching you how to think like a computer scientist. Being able to understand computation is much more valuable than just learning how to write code. If you’re interested in learning more about Java itself, Oracle maintains an official set of tutorials on its website (https://thinkjava.org/tutorial). The “Language Basics” tutorial, found under “Learning the Java Language”, is a good place to start. One of the most interesting aspects of writing programs is deciding how to solve a particular problem, especially when there are multiple solutions. For example, there are numerous ways to sort a list of numbers, and each way has its advantages. In order to determine which way is best for a given situation, we need techniques for describing and analyzing solutions formally. Analgorithmis a sequence of steps that specifies how to solve a problem. Some algorithms are faster than others, and some use less space in computer memory.Computer scienceis the science of algorithms, including their discovery and analysis. As you learn to develop algorithms for problems you haven’t solved before, you will learn to think like a computer scientist. Designing algorithms and writing code is difficult and error-prone. For historical reasons, programming errors are calledbugs, and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is calleddebugging. As you learn to debug your programs, you will develop new problem-solving skills. You will need to think creatively when unexpected errors happen. Although it can be frustrating, debugging is an intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting part of computer science. In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues, and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see. Thinking about how to correct programs and improve their performance sometimes even leads to the discovery of new algorithms. 1.9 Debugging Programs 11 1.9 Debugging Programs It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so you can try out the examples as you go. You can run many of the examples directly in DrJava’s Interactions pane (see Appendix??). But if you put the code in a source file, it will be easier to try out variations. Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should also try to make mistakes. For example, in the Hello World program, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks? What if you leave out both? What if you spellprintlnwrong? These kinds of experiments help you remember what you read. They also help with debugging, because you learn what the error messages mean. It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later on and accidentally. Debugging is like an experimental science: once you have an idea about what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, then you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. Programminganddebuggingshouldgohandinhand. Don’tjustwriteabunch of code and then perform trial-and-error debugging until it all works. Instead, start with a program that doessomethingand make small modifications, debugging them as you go, until the program does what you want. That way, you will always have a working program, and isolating errors will be easier. AgreatexampleofthisprincipleistheLinuxoperatingsystem, whichcontains millions of lines of code. It started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386 chip. According to Larry Greenfield inThe Linux Users’ Guide, “One of Linus’s earlier projects was a program that would switch between printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved to Linux.” Finally, programming sometimes brings out strong emotions. If you are struggling with a difficult bug, you might feel angry, despondent, or embarrassed. Remember that you are not alone, and virtually every programmer has had similar experiences. Don’t hesitate to reach out to a friend and ask questions! 12 Chapter 1 Computer Programming 1.10 Vocabul
