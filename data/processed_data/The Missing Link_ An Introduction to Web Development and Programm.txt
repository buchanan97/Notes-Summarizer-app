About the Textbook Web development is an evolving amalgamation of languages that work in concert to re - ceive, modify, and deliver information between parties using the Internet as a mechanism of delivery. While it is easy to describe conceptually, implementation is accompanied by an overwhelming variety of languages, platforms, templates, frameworks, guidelines, and stan - dards. Navigating a project from concept to completion often requires more than mastery of one or two complementing languages, meaning today’s developers need both breadth, and depth, of knowledge to be effective. This text provides the developer with an understanding of the various elements of web development by focusing on the concepts and fundamentals through the examples within, providing a foundation that allows easier transition to other languages and a better un - derstanding of how to approach their work. The reader will be introduced to topics in a manner that follows most project development methods, from initial conceptualization and design through front end development, back end development, and introducing additional concepts like accessibility and security, while focusing on responsive design techniques. Each section of the text includes opportunities to practice the material and assess increased knowledge after examining the topics. About the Author Michael Mendez, M.S. , is a professional web developer and professor with a master’s degree received after studying computer science, business, and communications at the State University of New York, University at Fredonia. Having worked in the information tech - nology field for over 12 years, he has provided the small to medium business market and public sector agencies with services in hardware and network installation and support, web development, systems support and maintenance, and solutions design and implementation. These experiences have involved academic, media, emergency management, non-profit, business to business, and business to consumer organizations. Reviewer’s Notes It is always a challenge to teach a course in web design or web programming. Systems that run on the World Wide Web must necessarily change with the emergence of any sort of new computer technology, creating a rapidly evolving landscape. The students that enroll in web development courses are a particularly diverse group; the subject attracts strong programmers with weak aesthetic design skills as well as those who are more aesthetically inclined with little knowledge of programming. Finally, the visibility and mission criticality of web platforms makes the design and security of these systems paramount. The Missing Link attempts to bridge the gap between these conflicting educational de - mands. While most web development texts opt to delve deeply into one or two of the tools in the belt of a web programmer, the author of this text takes a broad approach to teaching web programming and development. The result is a single resource that integrates good design practices, modern technologies, and all of the programming tools that one would need to build a successful, dynamic web site. Unlike many texts, this one begins by giving the readers a solid foundation in the tech - nology that runs the Internet along with a sense of what technology is currently coming of age. This is followed by both a process and pattern-oriented slant on web design that fo - cuses on the Model-View-Controller structure which underlies the rest of the text. HTML and CSS covered for the development of web interfaces. The PHP and JavaScript sections enable readers to develop the controllers for those interfaces. Finally, a concise introduction to databases and SQL allows for the development of robust data models. In addition to the unique combination of content found in this book, the tone is also one of practicality. The author doesn’t mince words and gets right to the point with ex - amples meant to be referenced quickly and often. Although this directness may put off some readers who prefer to read texts cover to cover, all software developers know that this is how texts are used in the real world. In the end, the broad approach that The Missing Link takes to web design and pro - gramming combined with the text’s concise presentation of information makes this a web programming text unlike any other.

First, the volume of free, online reference materials including video tutorials, community groups, and books (now including this text) is so far greater than what a single printed volume could handle, that the idea of creating a comprehensive source seemed laughably redundant. Second, many of the texts that march across my desk for review each semester focus primarily on the underpinnings of a particular language, while spending little time introducing or reinforcing the methodology and general practice of the language in question. While this allows those authors to delve deeper into limited topics, I have found that focusing on how languages relate and intertwine is often more beneficial, especially when just beginning to study web development. Studying languages independent of one another does little to prepare a programmer for complex systems involving multiple languages. This text is meant to reduce the confusion brought about by integrating multiple languages into one site while at the same time providing an overview of the entire devel - opment process. Within, you will find information on a variety of topics involved in the overall process of planning, designing, and finally creating a website; this background will help you understand how these pieces fit together, so you are better able to understand and contribute to a project and work with others on your team. As this is an introductory level text, the goal is not to exhaust the covered topics. Instead we will focus on familiarizing ourselves with each language’s abilities and how to fuse those languages and methods together to create a responsive, well-developed site. You will frequently find links and keywords throughout the text, which you can use as a starting point to further research topics that interest you. We will examine web development in a full stack approach; the premise behind the phrase “full stack developer” is that the person has an understanding of all of the elements necessary to create and run a website. The topics included below all lend themselves towards this goal by touching each aspect of the process.

The military at the time relied in part on microwave transmission technology for communications. An unexpected attack on some of these towers demonstrated how susceptible the technology was to failure of even small portions of the transmission path. This led the military to seek a method of commu - nicating that could withstand attack. At the same time, university researchers were trying to share their work between campuses, and were struggling with similar problems when their transmissions suffered drops in signal. Parties from both groups ended up at the same conference with presentations, and decided to collaborate in order to further their work. At the time, computers were far from what we know them as today. A single computer was a large, immobile assortment of equipment that took up an entire room. Data entry was done by using punched cards of paper, or the newest method of the time, magnetic tapes. Interacting with the computer meant reserving time on the equipment and traveling to where it was. Most machines were owned by universities, large corporations, or government organizations due to the staffing demands, size, and cost to acquire and maintain them. The image below depicts the UNIVAC 1, a system used by the United States Census Bureau and other large organizations like universities. One of the fastest machines at the time, it could perform roughly 1000 calculations per second. US Army, Public Domain, via Wikimedia Figure 1 UNIV AC Computer System In comparison, the K computer, a super computer produced in 2012 by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was capable of 10 petaflops per second when it was launched. Before 3The Missing Link: An Introduction to Web Development and Programming Chapter 1 you reach for your dictionary or calculator, we will break that down. FLOPS stands for floating point operations per second, or in basic terms, the number of calculations the system can finish in one second. A petaflop is a numerical indicator of how many 1015 (10 with 15 zeroes after it) calculations are completed per second. So, 10 petaflops means the K computer can complete 1015 calculations ten times in one second. If we fed the UNIVAC 1 just a single petaflop of data the day it was turned on, it would still be working on the problem today. In fact, it would barely be getting started, just a mere 60+ years into a roughly 317,098-year task! ADDITIONAL NOTES You may have heard of Moore’s Law, commonly defined as the tendency of technology’s capability to double every two years. Moore’s actual prediction was that this would apply to transistors, an element of circuits, and that it would continue for ten years after seeing its trend from 1958 to 1964. His prediction has shown to be applicable to memory capacity, speed, storage space as well as other factors and is commonly used as a bench mark for future growth. As cold war tensions grew and Sputnik was launched, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) began to seek additional methods of transmitting information to supple - ment existing methods. They sought something that was decentralized, allowing better resiliency in case of attack, where damage at one point would not necessarily disrupt com - munication. Their network, Arpanet, connected the DoD and participating universities together for the first time. In order to standardize the way networked systems commu - nicated, the Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) was created. As various network systems migrated to this standard, they could then communicate with any network using the protocol. The Internet was born. Email was soon to follow, as users of the networks were interested in the timely trans - mission and notification of messages. This form of messaging fit one of their initial goals. As time progressed, additional protocols were developed to address particular tasks, like FTP for file transfers and UDP for time-sensitive, error-resistant tasks. Ongoing improvements in our ability to move more information, and move it faster, between systems progressed at a rate similar to the calculative power of the computers we saw earlier. This brings us to where we are today; able to watch full-length movies, streamed in high quality right to our phones and computers, even while riding in a car.

New products and innovations can greatly affect the landscape in a short amount of time. We can look to the rapid rise in Facebook, Twitter, and the myriad of Google services now relied upon around the world as examples of how fast new technology is embraced. Cloud Computing Figure 2 Cloud Computing Styles Cloud computing can be loosely defined as the allocation of hardware and/or software under a service model (resources are assigned and consumed as needed). Typically, what we hear today referred to as cloud computing is the concept of business-to-business commerce revolving around “Company A” selling or renting their services to “Company B” over the Internet. A cloud can be public (hosted on a public internet, shared among consumers) or private (cloud concepts of provisioning and storage are applied to servers within a fire wall or internal network that is privately managed), and can also fall into some smaller subsets in between, as depicted in the graphic above. Under Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) computing model, which is what is most com - monly associated with the term cloud computing, one or more servers with significant amounts of processing power, capacity, and memory, are configured through hardware and/ 5The Missing Link: An Introduction to Web Development and Programming Chapter 2 or software methods to act as though they are multiple smaller systems that add up to their capacity. This is referred to as virtualizing, or virtual servers. These systems can be “right sized” where they only consume the resources they need on average, meaning many systems needing little resources can reside on one piece of hardware. When processing demands of one system expand or contract, resources from that server can be added or removed to account for the change. This is an alternative to multiple physical servers, where each would need the ability to serve not only the average but expected peak needs of system resources. Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, and the ever-expanding list of “as-a-service” models follow the same basic pattern of balancing time and effort. Platforms as a service allow central control of end user profiles, and software as a service allows simplified (and/ or automated) updating of programs and configurations. Storage as a service can replace the need to manually process backups and file server maintenance. Effectively, each “asa-service” strives to provide the end user with an “as-good-if-not-better” alternative to managing a system themselves, all while trying to keep the cost of their services less than a self-managed solution. ADDITIONAL NOTES One of the best methods to keep current is by following trade magazines, industry leader blogs, and simply browsing the internet looking for new items or site features you have not noticed before. Content aggregators like Zite, Feedly, and Slashdot are some of my favorites. As a micro-scale example, imagine you and four friends are all starting small businesses. Faced with the costs of buying servers and software for data storage, web hosting, and office programs, each of you would invest funds into equipment and the staff to maintain it, even though much of it may get little use in the early stages of your company. This high initial investment reduces available funding that may have been used elsewhere, and your return on investment becomes longer. Instead, each of you would create an account with Amazon’s cloud services for file storage and website hosting, which are private to you, but physically stored on servers shared by other users. Since these services are managed offsite by Amazon staff, none of you need to hire IT staff to manage these servers, nor do you have to invest in the equipment itself. Just by not needing to hire a system administrator (estimated at $40,000 salary) you can pay for just over 3 years of Amazon service (calculated using Ama - zon’s pricing calculator1 for basic web services and file storage). When you combine the savings of that employee’s fringe costs like health care, along with those of not purchasing your own hardware, this approach can make your initial investment last longer. These lowered costs are attractive to small businesses and startups for obvious reasons, but are also attractive to large companies with highly fluctuating levels of need. For example, a football team’s website sees far more traffic on game days than the off-season. They do not need the ability to serve the same amount of users all the time. Some tangible examples of “as-a-service” tools you may already be using are file hosting services like Dropbox2 or Google Drive .3 Your files are kept on servers along with those from other users that you do not see (unless you share with them intentionally) and you can add or remove extra space 1 http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html 2 http://www.dropbox.com 3 http://drive.google.com 6The Missing Link: An Introduction to Web Development and Programming Chapter 2 to your account whenever you like. Similarly, services like Amazon Web Services4 offer the ability to host your files, applications, and more to both home consumers and commercial clients. Virtualization Server virtualization is the act of running multiple operating systems and other software on the same physical hardware at the same time, as we discussed in Cloud Computing . A hardware and/or software element is responsible for managing the physical system re - sources at a layer in between each of the operating systems and the hardware itself. Doing so allows the consolidation of physical equipment into fewer devices, and is most beneficial when the servers sharing the hardware are unlikely to demand resources at the same time, or when the hardware is powerful enough to serve all of the installations simultaneously. The act of virtualizing is not just for use in cloud environments, but can be used to decrease the “server sprawl,” or overabundance of physical servers, that can occur when physical hardware is installed on a one-to-one (or few-to-one) scale to applications and sites being served. Special hardware and/or software is used to create a new layer in between the physical resources of your computer and the operating system(s) running on it. This layer manages what each system sees as being the hardware available to it, and manages allocation of resources and the settings for all virtualized systems. Hardware virtualization, or the stand alone approach, sets limits for each operating system and allows them to operate independent of one another. Since hardware virtualization does not require a sepa - rate operating system to manage the virtualized system(s), it has the potential to operate faster and consume fewer resources than software virtualization. Software virtualization, or the host-guest approach, requires the virtualizing software to run on an operating system already in use, allowing simpler management to occur from the initial operating system and virtualizing program, but can be more demanding on system resources even when the primary operating system is not being used. Ultimately, you can think of virtualization like juggling. In this analogy, your hands are the servers, and the balls you juggle are your operating systems. The traditional approach of hosting one application on one server is like holding one ball in each hand. If your hands are both “busy” holding a ball, you cannot interact with anything else without putting a ball down. If you juggle them, however, you can “hold” three or more balls at the same time. Each time your hand touches a ball is akin to a virtualized system needing resources, and having those resources allocated by the virtualization layer (the juggler) assigning resources (a hand), and then reallocating for the next system that needs them. 4 http://aws.amazon.com 7The Missing Link: An Introduction to Web Development and Programming Chapter 2 By Daniel Hirschbach [CC-BY-SA-2.0 Germany] via Wikimedia Figure 3 Virtualization Styles The addition of a virtual machine as shown above allows the hardware or software to see the virtual machine as part of the regular system. The monitor itself divides the resources allocated to it into subsets that act as their own computers. Net Neutrality This topic is commonly misconstrued as a desire for all Internet content to be free of cost and without restrictions based on its nature. In fact, net neutrality is better defined as efforts to ensure that all content (regardless of form or topic) and the means to access it, are protected as equal.
