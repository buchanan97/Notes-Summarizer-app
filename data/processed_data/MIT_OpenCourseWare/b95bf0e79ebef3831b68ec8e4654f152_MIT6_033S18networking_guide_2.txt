so many packets at once. Switches contain queues , which store packets that they ve received but cannot send yet (because their outgoing link isbusy sending other packets). If a packet arrives when the queue is full, that packet will bedropped ; it disappears from the network. Full queues are one reason that a network might experience loss . Other reasons are if a switch crashes or if a link fails (e.g., an Ethernet cable gets cut). For some applications, this type of loss is okay; others might desire reliable transport, where more effort is made to deliver data reliably . Reliable transport protocols provide reliable but not perfect transport. These protocols, and many others, are part of the transport layer, which sits above the network layer. That implies that transport layer protocols don t care what routing protocol the network is using, e.g. This discussion also reveals yet another layer: the application layer. Ultimately , applications like Skype, Spotify, or other applications that you might run generate the network traf c. As revealed, different applications desire different things. Besides reliability , there are other ways to think about how the network performs: -How much data can it transport over some unit of time? There are many ways to think about this: what is the physical speed that the underlying links are capable of? How much data is the network actually sending (say, per second), which is based at least partly on how muchtraf c the endpoints are generating? Etc. There are lots of terms you ll see used to describethese concepts: the speed of a network, its bandwidth, its throughput, etc. -How long does it take a packet to
