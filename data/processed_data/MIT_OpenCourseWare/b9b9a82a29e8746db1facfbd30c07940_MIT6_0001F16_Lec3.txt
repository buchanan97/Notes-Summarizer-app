[SOURCE: MIT OpenCourseWare] STRING MANIPULATION, GUESS -and-CHECK, APPROXIMATIONS, BISECTION (download slides and . pyfiles follow along!) LECTURE LECTURE LAST TIME strings branching if elif else while loops for loops LECTURE TODAY string manipulation guess and check algorithms approximate solutions bisection method LECTURE STRINGS think of as a sequence of case sensitive characters can compare strings with , , etc . len()is a function used to retrieve the length of the string in the parentheses s "abc" len(s) evaluates to LECTURE STRINGS square brackets used to perform indexing into a string to get the value at a certain index position s "abc" s evaluates to "a" s evaluates to "b" s evaluates to "c" s trying to index out of bounds, error s - evaluates to "c" s - evaluates to "b" s - evaluates to "a" LECTURE 5index : indexing always starts at index : - - - last element always at index - STRINGS can slice strings using start:stop:step if give two numbers, start:stop , step by default you can also omit numbers and leave just colons LECTURE 6s "abcdefgh " s : evaluates to "def", same ass : : s : : evaluates to "df" s :: evaluates to "abcdefgh ", same as s :len(s): s ::- evaluates to "hgfedbca ", same as s - :-(len(s) ): - s : :- evaluates to "ec" STRINGS strings are immutable cannot be modified s "hello" s 'y' gives an error s 'y' s :len(s) is allowed, s bound to new object LECTURE 7s"hello" "yello" for LOOPS RECAP for loops have a loop variable that iterates over a set of values for varin range( ): var iterates over values , ,
