. Isolation: multipl e soldiers need to add to daily-log.txt at the same time (risk is that they override each other work, and someone get red be cause not productiv e!!) .

The risk is police taking down our operation!) Using the le system, you realize that most probably you will fail, and that can be very dangerous Luckily you are enrolled in and you just learned that: Datab ases address all of these issues!! you migh t have a chance! In fact, you migh t notice that the issues listed above are already related to the three concepts we mentioned before: - are problems related to Data Model, - are problems related to the Query language and - are problems related to Transactions. So let s try to do the same with a database and get the boss what he needs. More on fundamen tal concepts Database are a micro cosm of computer science, their study covers: languages, theory , operating systems, concurren t programming, user interfaces, optimiza tion, algorithms, arti cial intelligence, system design, parallel and distributed systems, statistical techniques, dynamic progr amming. Some of the key con cepts we will investigate are: Represen ting Data We need a consisten t structur ed way to represen t data, this is importan t for consistency , sharing, e ciency of access.
