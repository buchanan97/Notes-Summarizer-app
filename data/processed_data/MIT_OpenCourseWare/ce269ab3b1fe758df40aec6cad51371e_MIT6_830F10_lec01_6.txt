more arti cial-in teligence statistical mining related areas that are also part of database researc h. Instead, we will explore some of the recen t advanc ed topics in datab ase research see class schedule to get an idea of the topics . Back to our Ma a database What features of our organization shall we store? How do we want to capture them? Choose a level of abstraction and describ e only the relevant details (e.g., I don t care about favorite movies for my soldiers, but I need to store their phone numbers). Let s focus on a subset: each person has real name, nickname, phone number each operation has a name, descripti on, economical value, cover-up name info about the persons involved in an operation and their role, We could represen t this data accordin g to many di eren t data models: hierarc hies objects graph triples etc.. Let s try using an XML hierarc hical le: person name name nickname nickname phone phone operation op name op name description description econ value econ value coverup name coverup name operation person Operations are duplicated in each person, this migh t make the update very tricky (inconsistencies) and the represen tation very verbose and redundan t. Otherwise we can organize the other way around with people inside operations, well we would have people replicated. Another possibilit y is using a graph structure with people, names, nick names,phones, operation names etc.. as nodes, and edges to represen t relation ships between them. Or we could have objects and metho ds on them, or triples like carlo,is a,person , carlo,phone,5554348882 etc.. Di er ent data models are more suite
