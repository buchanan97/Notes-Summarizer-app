world I need to represen t? how many details? . How to store data: maybe we can use just les: people.txt, organiza tions.txt, operations.txt, money .txt, daily-log.txt. Each les contains a textual represen tation of the information with one item per line. . Control access creden tials at low granularit y: accoun tants should know about money movemen t, but not the name s and addresses of our soldiers. Soldiers should know about operations, but not access money information . How to access data: we could write a separate procedural program opening one or more les, scanning through them and reading writing information in them. . Access patterns and performance: how to nd shop we didn t col lected money from for the longest time (and at least month)? scan the huge operation le, sort by time, pick the oldest, measure time? (need to be timely or they will stop paying, and this get the boss mad you surely don t want that, and make sure no one is accessing it right now). Tony Schifezza is a mole, we need to nd all the operations and people he was involved or knew about and shut them down quick like REAL quick!!! . Atomicit y: when an accoun tant moves money from one place to another you need to guaran tee that either money are remo ved from accoun t A and added to accoun t B, or nothing at all happ ens (You do not want to have money vanishing, unless you plan to vanish too!). . Consistency: guaran tee that the data are always in a valid state (e.g., there are no two operation s with the same name)
