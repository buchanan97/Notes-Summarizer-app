[SOURCE: MIT OpenCourseWare] MIT 2017 Ten-minute Networking Extravaganza This is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to networking. It contains the very basics that you need to know to understand how a network works; some terms havebeen intentionally de ned imprecisely, and many details have been left out. We ll ll in a lot of those details, and make a lot of de nitions more precise, as the course goes on. A computer network facilitates communication between two or more computers. You can imagine having, say, ten computers, all connected to one another with Ethernet cables. That s one example of a computer network. We would say that each of those machines had a direct connection to one another, or a point-to-point link . These point-to-point links don t have to be Ethernet cables; they could be wireless links, satellite links, cellular links, etc. There are many different physical technologies that one can build a network out of. It isn t feasible to have every computer in the world directly connected to every other computer. Instead, most networks involve switches. Switches are devices that sit in the middle of the network, and help move data from one machine to another . Typically we ll refer to machines such as your computer as endpoints , to differentiate them from switches. Usually, endpoints initiate the sending of data, and data is sent to them; switches help move data through the network. As you can see, data from multiple different endpoints might pass through a single switch. There are multiple ways to handle this multiple ways to send more than one stream of datathrough a switch (to multiplex the network). The most
