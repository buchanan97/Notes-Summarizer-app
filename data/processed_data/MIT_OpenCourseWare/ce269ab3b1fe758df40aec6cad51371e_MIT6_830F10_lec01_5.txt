theory we have the right concepts. Data Model: a set of constructs (or a paradigm) to describ e the organiza tion of data. For example tables (or more precisely relations ), but we could also choose graph, hierarc hies, objects, triples sub ject,pr edicate,ob ject , etc.. Conc eptual L ogical Schema: is a description of a particular collection of data, using the a given data model (e.g., the schema of our Ma a database). Physic al Schema: is the physical organization of the data (e.g., data and index les on disk for our Ma a database). Declarativ e Querying and Query Processing a high-lev el (typically declar ative) language to describ e operations on data (e.g., queries, updates). The goal is to guaran tee Data indep endenc e (logical and physic al), by separating what you want to do with data from how to achieve that (more later). High level language for accessing data Data Indep endence (logical and physical) Optimization Techniques for e cien tly accessing data Transactions a way to group actions that must happ en atomically (all or nothing) guaran tees to move the DB content from a consisten t state to another isolate from parallel execution of other actions transactions recoverable in case of failure (e.g., power goes out) This provide the application with guaran tees about a group of actions even in presence of concurrency and failures. It is a unit of access and manipulati on of data. And signi can tly simplify the work of application developers. This course covers these concepts, and goes deep into the investigation of how modern DBMS are designed to achieve all that. We will not cover the
