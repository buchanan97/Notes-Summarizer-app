common way is to use packetswitching. In a packet-switched network, each piece of data a packet contains some meta-information attached to it, called a header . This header contains things such as the source address: the address of the machine where the packet is headed. As the packet passesthrough different switches, they can look at the packet header and gure out where the packet needs to go. A contrasting idea is circuit switching, where the relevant state is kept on switches instead of attached to teach packet. To actually get data from one place to another , a network rst needs to make sure every endpoint has a unique address . Depending on the size of the network, the addressing scheme may have to be clever in certain ways; for small networks, it s ne to just image that a centralized service gives every endpoint a unique address. In addition to addresses, a network needs a routing protocol. That is a protocol that helps it nd routes through the network. Once a switch has run a routing protocol, when it gets a packetdestined for Machine A, it knows which switch to send the packet to next. With addressing and routing, we now have a network that works, at least to an extent: endpoints can send data to one another. Importantly, addressing and routing protocols don t need to worry about what physical technology is running underneath : a routing protocol can work over an Ethernet network, a wireless network, etc. This is thanks to layering : the physical layer need not be concerned with what the network layer is doing, and vice versa. Each switch is only capable of handling
