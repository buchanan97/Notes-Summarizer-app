[SOURCE: MIT OpenCourseWare] WELCOME! (download slides and . pyfiles and follow along!) LECTURE LECTURE TODAY course info what is computation python basics mathematical operations python variables and types NOTE: slides and code files up before each lecture ohighly encourage you to download them before lecture otake notes and run code files when I do obring computers to answer in-class practice exercises! LECTURE COURSE INFO Grading approx . Quiz approx. Final approx . Problem Sets approx . MITx Finger Exercises LECTURE COURSE POLICIES Collaboration may collaborate with anyone required to write code independently and write names of all collaborators on submission we will be running a code similarity program on all psets Extensions no extensions late days , see course website for details drop and roll weight of max two psets in final exam grade should be EMERGENCY use only LECTURE RECITATIONS not mandatory two flavors ) Lecture review: review lecture material oif you missed lecture oif you need a different take on the same concepts ) Problem solving: teach you how to solve programming problems ouseful if you don t know how to set up pseudocode from pset words owe show a couple of harder questions owalk you through how to approach solving the problem obrainstorm code solution along with the recitation instructor owill post solutions after LECTURE FAST PACED COURSE Position yourself to succeed! read psets when they come out and come back to them later use late days in emergency situations New to programming? PRACTICE. PRACTICE? PRACTICE! can t passively absorb programming as a skill download code before lecture and follow along do MITx finger exercises don t be afraid to try out Python commands!
