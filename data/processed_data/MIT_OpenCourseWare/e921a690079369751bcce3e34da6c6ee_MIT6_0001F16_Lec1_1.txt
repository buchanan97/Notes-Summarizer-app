PROBLEM SOLVING PROGRAMMING SKILLKNOWLEDGE OF CONCEPTS TOPICS represent knowledge with data structures iteration and recursion as computational metaphors abstraction of procedures and data types organize and modularize systems using object classes and methods different classes of algorithms , searching and sorting complexity of algorithms LECTURE WHAT DOES A COMPUTER DO Fundamentally: performs calculations a billion calculations per second! remembers results 100s of gigabytes of storage! What kinds of calculations? built -into the language ones that you define as the programmer computers only know what you tell them LECTURE TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE declarative knowledge is statements of fact . someone will win a Google Cardboard before class ends imperative knowledge is a recipe or how -to . )Students sign up for raffle )Ana opens her IDE )Ana chooses a random number between 1stand nthresponder )Ana finds the number in the responders sheet. Winner! LECTURE A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE square root of a number x is y such that y y x recipe for deducing square root of a number x ( ) )Start with a guess , g )If g g is close enough to x, stop and say g is the answer )Otherwise make a new guess by averaging g and x g )Using the new guess, repeat process until close enough LECTURE 11g g g x g (g x g) WHAT IS A RECIPE ) sequence of simple steps ) flow of control process that specifies when each step is executed ) a means of determining when to stop an algorithm ! LECTURE COMPUTERS ARE MACHINES how to capture a recipe in a mechanical process fixed program computer calculator stored program computer machine stores and executes instructions LECTURE BASIC MACHINE
