can represen t them using the standard relational query language SQL: Whic h operations involve Tony Schifezza ? SELECT oper name FROM involved WHERE person "tony"; Given the laundromat operation, get the phone numbers of all the people involved in operations using it as a cover up. SELECT p.phone FROM person p, operation o, involve i WHERE p.name i.person AND i.oper name o.name AND o.coverup name "laundromat"; Reassign Tony s operations to Sam and remo ve Tony from the database (he was the mole). BEGIN UPDATE involved i SET pers name "sam" WHERE pers name "tony"; DELETE FROM person WHERE name "tony"; COMMIT Create a new operation with Sam Astuto in charge of it. BEGIN INSERT INTO operation VALUES ( newop1 , , , Sam s bakery ); INSERT INTO involve VALUES ( newop1 , sam , chief ); COMMIT Let us reconsider the procedural approac h. You migh t organize data into les: one record of each table in a le, and maybe sort the data by one of the elds. Now every di eren t access to the data, i.e., every query should become a di eren t program opening the les, scanning them, reading or writing certain elds, saving the les. Extras The two following concepts have been broadly mentioned but not discussed in details in class. Optimization The goal of a DBMS is to provide a library of sophisticated techniques and strategy to store, access, update data that also guaran tees per formance, atomicit y, consistency , isolation, durabilit y. DBMS automatically compile the user declarativ e queries into an execution plan (i.e., a strategy that applies various steps to achieve the compute the user queries),
