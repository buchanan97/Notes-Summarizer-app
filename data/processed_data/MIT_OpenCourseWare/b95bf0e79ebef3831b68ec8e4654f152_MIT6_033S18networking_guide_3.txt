get from one end of the network to the other? This quantityis referred to as latency. The latency of a network is affected by its physical properties, aswell as how much other data is in the network. There are a number of other things we can ask of our networks: -Does it provide multicast: the ability to send a piece of data to multiple endpoints at once,instead of just one? The implication there is that the underlying network replicates the datawhere appropriate; the sender sends a single copy, while somehow specifying the endpointsthat should receive it. If a network provides the ability to multicast to all endpoints at once(sometimes, all in-range endpoints), we say that network provides broadcast . -Does it allow for prioritization, where different types of data are treated differently? For instance, perhaps a switch prioritizes HTTP packets, sending those before all others. -Does the network support any other policies ? Usually, those policies are set by a human, not automated by the network. Prioritizing certain types of data is one example of a policy. In this discussion, we ve presented a four-layer model: physical, network, transport, andapplication. One of the most widely-used models actually uses seven layers: a link layer sitsbetween the physical and network layers, and the session and presentation layers sitbetween the transport and application layers. There s no need to worry about the details of those layers at the moment.
