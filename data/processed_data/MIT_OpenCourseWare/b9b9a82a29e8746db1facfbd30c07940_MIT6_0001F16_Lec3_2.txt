! abs(cube): print(cube , 'is not a perfect cube') else: if cube : guess -guess print('Cube root of ' str(cube) ' is ' str(guess)) LECTURE APPROXIMATE SOLUTIONS good enough solution start with a guess and increment by some small value keep guessing if guess3-cube epsilon for some small epsilon decreasing increment size slower program increasing epsilon less accurate answer LECTURE APPROXIMATE SOLUTION cube root cube epsilon guess increment num guesses while abs(guess -cube) epsilon: guess increment num guesses print('num guesses ', num guesses ) if abs(guess -cube) epsilon: print('Failed on cube root of', cube) else: print(guess, 'is close to the cube root of', cube)and guess cube : LECTURE BISECTION SEARCH half interval each iteration new guess is halfway in between to illustrate, let s play a game! LECTURE GUESS GUESS GUESS BISECTION SEARCH cube root cube epsilon num guesses low high cube guess (high low ) while abs(guess -cube) epsilon: if guess cube : low guess else: high guess guess (high low) num guesses print 'num guesses ', num guesses print guess, 'is close to the cube root of', cube LECTURE BISECTION SEARCH CONVERGENCE search space first guess: N second guess: N kth guess: N 2k guess converges on the order of log2 Nsteps bisection search works when value of function varies monotonically with input code as shown only works for positive cubes why? challenges modify to work with negative cubes! modify to work with x ! LECTURE x if x , search space is to x but cube root is greater than x and less than modify the code to choose the search space depending on value of x LECTURE MIT Open Course Ware https: ocw.mit.edu Introduction to Computer
