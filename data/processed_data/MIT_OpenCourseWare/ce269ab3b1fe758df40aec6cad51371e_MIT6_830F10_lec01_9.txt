External schema A set of views over the logical schema, that predicates how users see access data. (e.g., a set of views for the accoun tants). It is often not physically materialized, but main tain as a view query on top of the data. Let try to show only coverup names of operations worth less or equal to M and the nicknames of all people involved using a view (see Figure ): CREATE VIEW nick-cover AS SELECT nickname, coverup name FROM operation o, involved i, person p WHERE p.name i.person AND i.oper name o.name AND o.econ val M; schifezzalaundromatlungoirish pubbaffolaundromatnicknamecoverupnick-cover Figure : Simple External Schema for a portion of our Ma a database. What s next? Next week lessons introduce more formally the relational model (and some of its history) and how to design the schema of a database. After that we will dive into the DBMS internals and study how DBMS are internally architected to achieve all the functionalities we discuss ed. Later on we will study how to guaran tee transactional behaviors, and how to scale a DBMS beyond a single node. The last portion of the course is devoted to more esoteric topics from recen t advances in database researc h.
