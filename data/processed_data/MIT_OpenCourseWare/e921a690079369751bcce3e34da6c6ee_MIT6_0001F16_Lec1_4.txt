objects and operators to form expressions an expression has a value , which has a type syntax for a simple expression object operator object LECTURE OPERATORS ON intsand floats i j the sum i-j the difference i j the product i j division i j the remainder when iis divided by j i j ito the power of j LECTURE 29if both are ints, result is int if either or both are floats, result is float result is float SIMPLE OPERATIONS parentheses used to tell Python to do these operations first operator precedence without parentheses and executed left to right, as appear in expression LECTURE BINDING VARIABLES AND VALUES equal sign is an assignment of a value to a variable name pi pi approx value stored in computer memory an assignment binds name to value retrieve value associated with name or variable by invoking the name, by typing pi LECTURE ABSTRACTING EXPRESSIONS why give names to values of expressions? to reuse names instead of values easier to change code later pi radius area pi (radius ) LECTURE PROGRAMMING vs MATH in programming, you do not solve for x pi radius area of circle area pi (radius ) radius radius LECTURE CHANGING BINDINGS can re-bind variable names using new assignment statements previous value may still stored in memory but lost the handle for it value for area does not change until you tell the computer to do the calculation again LECTURE 34pi radius area3. .2pi radius area pi (radius ) radius radius MIT Open Course Ware https: ocw.mit.edu Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python Fall 2016 For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https:
