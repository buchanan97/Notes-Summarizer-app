d for di er ent problems. They di eren t expressiv e power and di eren t strengths depending on what data you want to represen t and how you need to access them. Let s choose the relation al data model and represen t this problem using ta bles . Again there are many ways to structure the represen tation, i.e., di eren t conceptual logical schemas that could captu re the realit y are modeling. For example we can have a single big table with all info together again, is redun dant and migh t slow down all the access to data. The database design is the art of capturing a set of real world concepts and their relations in the best possible organization in a database. A good represen tation is shown in Figure . It is not redundan t and contains all the information we care about. shifezzatony789lungo456mikebaffocarlo123namenicknamephonepersonoperation..laundromatirish pubirish pubchocolatesnowflakecoverupcaffe Mecon valtitledescr M Mchocolatemikechiefsnowflakesoldtonycarlosnowflakechiefpers nameoper namerolsinvolved Figure : Simple Logical Schema for a portion of our Ma a database. What about the physical organization of the data? As a database user you can ignor e the problem , thanks to the physical indep endence! As a studen t of this class you will devote a lot of e ort in learning how to best organize data physically to provide great performance to access data. Accessing the data (transactionally) As we introduced before databases provide high-lev el declarativ e query lan guages. The key idea is that you describ e what you want to access, rather than how to acces s it. Let s consider the following operations you want to do on data, and how we
