, expressions expressions inside loop executed with each value for var for varin range( , ): var iterates over values , expressions range is a way to iterate over numbers, but a for loop variable can iterate over any set of values , not just numbers! LECTURE STRINGS AND LOOPS these two code snippets do the same thing bottom one is more pythonic s "abcdefgh " for index in range( len(s)): if s index ' i' or s index 'u': print("There is an ior u") for char in s: if char ' i' or char 'u': print("There is an ior u") LECTURE CODE EXAMPLE: ROBOT CHEERLEADERS an letters "aefhilmnorsx AEFHILMNORSX " word input("I will cheer for you! Enter a word: ") times int(input("Enthusiasm level ( - ): ")) i while i len(word): char word i if char in an letters : print("Give me an " char "! " char) else: print("Give me a " char "! " char) i print("What does that spell ?") for iin range(times): print(word , "!!!") LECTURE 10for char in word: EXERCISE s1 "mitu rock" s2 "irule mit" if len(s1) len(s2): for char1 in s1: for char2 in s2: if char1 char2: print("common letter") break LECTURE GUESS -AND -CHECK the process below also called exhaustive enumeration given a problem you are able to guess a value for solution you are able to check if the solution is correct keep guessing until find solution or guessed all values LECTURE GUESS -AND -CHECK cube root cube for guess in range(cube ): if guess cube: print("Cube root of", cube, "is", guess) LECTURE GUESS -AND -CHECK cube root cube for guess in range(abs(cube) ): if guess abs(cube): break if guess
