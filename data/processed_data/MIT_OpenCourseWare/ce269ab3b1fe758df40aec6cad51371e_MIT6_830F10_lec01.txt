[SOURCE: MIT OpenCourseWare] Notes for Lecture : Introduction to Database Systems Carlo A. Curino September , 2010 Introduction READING MATERIAL: Ramakrishnan and Gehrke Chapter What is a database? A database is a collection of structured data. A database captures an abstract representation of the domain of an application. Typically organized as records (traditionally, large numbers, on disk) and relationships between records This class is about database management systems (DBMS) : systems for cre ating, manipulating, accessing a database. A DBMS is a (usually complex) piece of software that sits in front of a collection of data, and mediates applications accesses to the data, guaranteeing many properties about the data and the accesses. Why should you care? There are lots of applications that we don t o er classes on at MIT. Why are databases any di erent?

Web sites, big companies, scien ti c projects, all manage both day to day operations as well as business intelligence data mining. You need to know about datab ases if you want to be happy! The goal of a DBMS is to simplify the storing and accessing of data. To this purp ose DBMSs provide facilities that serve the most common operations performed on data. The database comm unity has devoted signi can t e ort in formalizing few key concepts that most application s exploit to manipulate data. This provides a formal
