ground for us to discuss the application requirements on data storage and access, and compare ways for the DBMS to meet such requiremen ts. This will provide you with powerful conceptual tools that go beyond the speci c topics we tackle in this class, and are of general use for any application that needs to deal with data. Now we proceed in showing an example, and show how hard is doing things without a DB, later we will introduce formal DB concepts and show how much easier things are using a DB. Ma a Example Today we cover the user perspective, trying to detail the many reason we want to use a DBMS rather than organi zing and accessing data directly , for example as les. Let us assume I am a Ma a Boss (Note: despite the accen t this is not the case, but only hypothetical!) and I want to organize my group of picciotti (sicilian for the criminals bad guys working for the boss, a.k.a the soldiers, see Figure ) to achieve more e ciency in all our operations. I will also need a lot of book-keeping, securit y priv acy etc..
