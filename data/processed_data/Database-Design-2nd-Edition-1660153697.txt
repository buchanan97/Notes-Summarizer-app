Ackno wledgemen ts | ix Chapter 1 Befor e the Advent of Database Systems ADRIENNE W ATT The w ay in which c omputers manag e data has c ome a long w ay over the last f ew de cades. T oday’s users tak e for gr anted the man y benef its found in a da tabase system. H owever, it wasn’t tha t long ag o tha t computers r elied on a much less elegan t and c ostly appr oach to da ta manag emen t called the f ile-base d system. File-base d System One w ay to k eep inf orma tion on a c omputer is to stor e it in permanen t files. A c ompan y system has a number o f applic ation pr ograms; e ach o f them is designe d to manipula te da ta files. These applic ation pr ograms ha ve been wri tten at the request o f the users in the or ganiza tion. N ew applic ations ar e adde d to the system as the ne ed arises. The system just descri bed is c alled the file-based system . Consider a tr aditional banking system tha t uses the f ile-base d system to manag e the or ganiza tion’s da ta sho wn in Figure 1.1. As w e can se e, ther e are dif ferent depar tmen ts in the bank. Each has i ts own applic ations tha t manag e and manipula te dif ferent data files. F or banking systems, the pr ograms ma y be use d to debi t or cr edit an ac count, find the balanc e of an ac count, add a ne w mor tgag e loan and g ener ate mon thly sta temen ts. Figure 1.1. Ex ample of a f ile-based system used by banks to manage data. Disadv antag es of the file-base d appr oach Using the f ile-base d system to k eep or ganiza tional inf orma tion has a number o f disad vantages. Liste d belo w ar e five examples. Data r edundan cy Often, wi thin an or ganiza tion, f iles and applic ations ar e created by dif ferent programmers fr om v arious depar tmen ts over long periods o f time. This c an le ad to data r edundancy, a situation tha t occurs in a da tabase when a f ield needs to be upda ted in mor e than one table. This pr actice can le ad to se veral pr oblems such as: 1 | Chapter 1 Bef ore the Ad vent of Database S ystems • Inconsistenc y in da ta forma t • The same inf orma tion being kept in se veral dif ferent plac es (files) • Data inconsistency , a si tuation wher e various c opies o f the same da ta ar e conflicting, w astes stor age spac e and duplic ates ef fort Data isolation Data isolation is a pr oper ty that determines when and ho w chang es made b y one oper ation be come visi ble to other concurr ent users and systems. This issue oc curs in a c oncurr ency situation. This is a pr oblem be cause: • It is dif ficult f or ne w applic ations to r etrieve the appr opria te da ta, which mig ht be stor ed in v arious f iles. Integrity pr oblems Problems wi th data integrity is another disad vantage of using a f ile-base d system. I t refers to the main tenanc e and assur ance tha t the da ta in a da tabase ar e correct and c onsisten t. Factors to c onsider when addr essing this issue ar e: • Data values must sa tisfy certain c onsistenc y constr aints tha t are spe cified in the applic ation pr ograms. • It is dif ficult to mak e chang es to the applic ation pr ograms in or der to enf orce new constr aints. Security pr oblems Security can be a pr oblem wi th a f ile-base d appr oach be cause: • Ther e are constr aints regar ding ac cessing privileg es. • Applic ation r equiremen ts ar e adde d to the system in an ad-hoc manner so i t is dif ficult to enf orce constr aints. Concurrency acces s Concurr ency is the abili ty of the da tabase to allo w multiple users ac cess to the same r ecord without ad versel y affecting transac tion pr ocessing. A f ile-base d system must manag e, or pr event, concurr ency by the applic ation pr ograms. Typic ally, in a f ile-base d system, when an applic ation opens a f ile, tha t file is lock ed. This me ans tha t no one else has access to the f ile at the same time. In da tabase systems, c oncurr ency is manag ed thus allo wing multiple users ac cess to the same r ecord. This is an impor tant difference between da tabase and f ile-base d systems. Database Appr oach The dif ficulties tha t arise fr om using the f ile-base d system ha ve pr ompte d the de velopmen t of a ne w appr oach in manag ing lar ge amoun ts of organiza tional inf orma tion c alled the database appr oach . Chapter 1 Bef ore the Ad vent of Database S ystems | 2 Databases and da tabase te chnolog y pla y an impor tant role in most ar eas wher e computers ar e use d, including business, education and me dicine. T o understand the fundamen tals o f database systems, w e will star t by introducing some basic concepts in this ar ea. Role of databases in busines s Everybod y uses a da tabase in some w ay, even if i t is just to stor e inf orma tion about their friends and famil y. Tha t data mig ht be wri tten do wn or stor ed in a c omputer b y using a w ord-pr ocessing pr ogram or i t could be sa ved in a spreadshe et. However, the best w ay to stor e data is b y using database management softwar e. This is a po werful so ftware tool tha t allo ws y ou to stor e, manipula te and r etrieve data in a v ariety of different ways. Most c ompanies k eep tr ack o f customer inf orma tion b y storing i t in a da tabase. This da ta ma y include customers, emplo yees, pr oduc ts, or ders or an ything else tha t assists the business wi th its oper ations. The me aning of data Data ar e fac tual inf orma tion such as me asur emen ts or sta tistics about obje cts and c oncepts. W e use da ta for discussions or as par t of a c alcula tion. D ata can be a person, a plac e, an e vent, an ac tion or an y one o f a number o f things. A sing le fact is an elemen t of data, or a data element . If data ar e inf orma tion and inf orma tion is wha t we are in the business o f working wi th, y ou c an star t to se e wher e you might be storing i t. Data can be stor ed in: • Filing c abine ts • Spreadshe ets • Folders • Ledgers • Lists • Piles o f papers on y our desk All o f these i tems stor e inf orma tion, and so too does a da tabase. Be cause o f the me chanic al na ture of databases, the y have terrif ic po wer to manag e and pr ocess the inf orma tion the y hold. This c an mak e the inf orma tion the y house much more useful f or your w ork.

Exercises Chapter 2 F undamen tal Conc epts | 8 Chapter 3 Char acteristics and Benefits of a Database ADRIENNE W ATT Manag ing inf orma tion me ans taking c are of it so tha t it works for us and is useful f or the tasks w e perf orm. B y using a DBMS, the inf orma tion w e collect and add to i ts da tabase is no long er subje ct to ac ciden tal disor ganiza tion. I t becomes more accessible and in tegrated wi th the r est o f our w ork. Manag ing inf orma tion using a da tabase allo ws us to be come strategic users o f the da ta we have. We often ne ed to ac cess and r e-sor t data for various uses. These ma y include: • Creating mailing lists • Writing manag emen t repor ts • Gener ating lists o f sele cted ne ws stories • Identifying v arious clien t needs The pr ocessing po wer of a da tabase allo ws it to manipula te the da ta it houses, so i t can: • Sort • Match • Link • Aggr egate • Skip f ields • Calcula te • Arrange Because o f the v ersatility of databases, w e find them po wering all sor ts of projects. A da tabase c an be link ed to: • A website tha t is c apturing r egister ed users • A clien t-tracking applic ation f or social ser vice organiza tions • A me dical record system f or a he alth c are facili ty • Your personal addr ess book in y our email clien t • A collection o f word-pr ocesse d documen ts • A system tha t issues air line r eser vations Char acteristics and Benefits of a Database Ther e are a number o f char acteristics tha t distinguish the da tabase appr oach fr om the f ile-base d system or appr oach. This chapter descri bes the benef its (and f eatures) of the da tabase system. Self-describing natur e of a database system A da tabase system is r eferred to as self-describing because i t not onl y contains the da tabase i tself, but also metadata which def ines and descri bes the da ta and r elationships be tween tables in the da tabase. This inf orma tion is 9 | Chapter 3 Char acteristics and Benef its of a D atabase used by the D BMS so ftware or da tabase users if ne eded. This separ ation of data and inf orma tion about the da ta makes a da tabase system totall y dif ferent from the tr aditional f ile-base d system in which the da ta def inition is par t of the applic ation pr ograms. Insulation betwe en pr ogram and data In the f ile-base d system, the struc ture of the da ta files is def ined in the applic ation pr ograms so if a user w ants to chang e the struc ture of a file, all the pr ograms tha t access tha t file mig ht need to be chang ed as w ell. On the other hand, in the da tabase appr oach, the da ta struc ture is stor ed in the system c atalogue and not in the programs. Ther efore, one chang e is all tha t is ne eded to chang e the struc ture of a f ile. This insula tion between the programs and da ta is also c alled program-da ta independenc e. Support for multiple views of data A da tabase suppor ts multiple vie ws o f data. A view is a subse t of the da tabase, which is def ined and de dicated for particular users o f the system. Multiple users in the system mig ht have dif ferent vie ws o f the system. Each vie w mig ht contain onl y the da ta of interest to a user or gr oup o f users. Sharing of data and multiuser system Curr ent database systems ar e designe d for multiple users. Tha t is, they allo w man y users to ac cess the same da tabase at the same time. This ac cess is achie ved thr ough features called concurr ency contr ol str ategies . These str ategies ensur e that the da ta ac cesse d are always correct and tha t data in tegri ty is main taine d. The design o f modern multiuser da tabase systems is a gr eat impr ovemen t from those in the past which r estric ted usag e to one person a t a time. Contr ol of data r edundancy In the da tabase appr oach, ide ally, each da ta item is stor ed in onl y one plac e in the da tabase. I n some c ases, da ta redundanc y still e xists to impr ove system perf ormanc e, but such r edundanc y is c ontrolled by applic ation pr ogramming and k ept to minimum b y introducing as li ttle redudanc y as possi ble when designing the da tabase. Data sharing The in tegration o f all the da ta, for an or ganiza tion, wi thin a da tabase system has man y ad vantages. F irst, i t allo ws for data sharing among emplo yees and others who ha ve access to the system. Se cond, i t gives users the abili ty to g ener ate more inf orma tion fr om a g iven amoun t of data than w ould be possi ble wi thout the in tegration. Chapter 3 Char acteristics and Benef its of a D atabase | 10 Enfor cement of integrity c onstr aints Database manag emen t systems must pr ovide the abili ty to def ine and enf orce certain c onstr aints to ensur e tha t users enter v alid inf orma tion and main tain da ta in tegri ty. A database constr aint is a r estric tion or rule tha t dic tates wha t can be en tered or e dited in a table such as a postal c ode using a c ertain f orma t or adding a v alid ci ty in the Ci ty field. Ther e are man y types o f database c onstr aints. Data type , for example, de termines the sor t of data permi tted in a f ield, for example numbers onl y. Data uniqueness such as the primar y key ensur es tha t no duplic ates ar e entered. Constr aints can be simple ( field base d) or c omple x (pr ogramming). Restriction of unauthorize d access Not all users o f a da tabase system will ha ve the same ac cessing privileg es. F or example, one user mig ht have read-onl y access (i.e., the abili ty to r ead a f ile but not mak e chang es), while another mig ht have read and write privileges , which is the abili ty to both r ead and modif y a f ile. F or this r eason, a da tabase manag emen t system should pr ovide a se curity subsystem to cr eate and c ontrol dif ferent types o f user ac counts and r estric t una uthoriz ed access. Data independenc e Another ad vantage of a da tabase manag emen t system is ho w it allo ws for da ta independenc e. In other w ords, the system data descriptions or da ta descri bing da ta (metada ta) are separ ated from the applic ation pr ograms. This is possi ble because chang es to the da ta struc ture are handle d by the da tabase manag emen t system and are not embe dded in the program itself. Transaction pr ocessing A da tabase manag emen t system must include c oncurr ency control subsystems. This f eature ensur es tha t data remains consisten t and v alid during tr ansac tion pr ocessing e ven if se veral users upda te the same inf orma tion. Provision for multiple views of data By its very nature, a D BMS permi ts man y users to ha ve access to i ts da tabase ei ther individuall y or simultane ously. It is not impor tant for users to be a ware of how and wher e the da ta the y access is stor ed Backup and r ecovery facilities Backup and r ecovery are me thods tha t allo w you to pr otect your da ta fr om loss. The da tabase system pr ovides a separ ate pr ocess, fr om tha t of a ne twork backup, f or backing up and r ecovering da ta. If a har d driv e fails and the 11 | Chapter 3 Char acteristics and Benef its of a D atabase database stor ed on the har d driv e is not ac cessible, the onl y way to r ecover the da tabase is fr om a backup. If a computer system fails in the middle o f a comple x upda te pr ocess, the r ecovery subsystem is r esponsi ble f or making sure tha t the da tabase is r estor ed to i ts orig inal sta te.
