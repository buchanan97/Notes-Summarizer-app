Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 2 Preface Maps are everywhere —on the Internet, in your car, and even on your mobile phone. Moreover, maps of the twenty -first century are not just paper diagrams folded li ke an accordion. Maps today are colorful, searchable, interactive, and shared. This transformation of the static map into dynamic and interactive multimedia reflects the integration of technological innovation and vast amounts of geographic data. The key t echnology behind this integration, and subsequently the maps of the twenty -first century, is geographic information systems or GIS. Put simply, GIS is a special type of information technology that integrates data and information from various sources as map s. It is through this integration and mapping that the question of “where” has taken on new meaning. From getting directions to a new restaurant in San Francisco on your mobile device to exploring what will happen to coastal cities like Venice if oceans we re to rise due to global warming, GIS provides insights into daily tasks and the big challenges of the future. Essentials of Geographic Information Systems integrates key concepts behind the technology with practical concerns and real -world applications. R ecognizing that many potential GIS users are nonspecialists or may only need a few maps, this book is designed to be accessible, pragmatic, and concise. Essentials of Geographic Information Systems also illustrates how GIS is used to ask questions, inform choices, and guide policy. From the melting of the polar ice caps to privacy issues associated with mapping, this book provides a gentle, yet substantive, introduction to the use and application of digital maps, mapping, and GIS. In today's world, learni ng involves knowing how and where to search for information. In some respects, knowing where to look for answers and information is arguably just as important as the knowledge itself. Because Essentials of Geographic Information Systems is concise, focused , and directed, readers are encouraged to search for supplementary information and to follow up on specific topics of interest on their own when necessary. Essentials of Geographic Information Systems provides the foundations for learning GIS, but readers are encouraged to construct their own individual frameworks of GIS knowledge. The benefits of this approach are two -fold. First, it Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 3 promotes active learning through research. Second, it facilitates flexible and selective learning —that is, what is learned i s a function of individual needs and interest. Since GIS and related geospatial and navigation technology change so rapidly, a flexible and dynamic text is necessary in order to stay current and relevant. Though essential concepts in GIS tend to remain constant, the situations, applications, and examples of GIS are fluid and dynamic. Though this book is intended for use in introductory GIS courses, Essentials of Geographic Information Systems will also appeal to the large number of certificate, professional, extension, and online programs in GIS that are available today. In addition to providing readers with the tools necessary to carry out spatial an alyses, Essentials of Geographic Information Systems outlines valuable cartographic guidelines for maximizing the visual impact of your maps. The book also describes effective GIS project management solutions that commonly arise in the modern workplace.

Knowing something about where something happens can help us to understand what happened, when it happened, how it happened, and why it happened. Whether it is an outbreak of a highly contagious disease, the discovery of a new frog species, the path of a deadly tornado, or the nearest location of a supermark et, knowing something about where things happen is important to how we understand and relate to our local environment and to the world at large. A geographic information system —or GIS —is a special type of information technology that can help us understand and relate to the “what,” “when,” “how,” and “why” of the world by answering “where.” Geographic information systems are indeed about maps, but they are also about much, much more. A GIS is used to organize, analyze, visualize, and share all kinds of data and information from different historical periods and at various scales of analysis. From climatologists trying to understand the causes and consequences of global warming, to epidemiologists locating ground zero of a virulent disease outbreak, to archaeologists reconstructing ancient Rome, to political consultants developing campaign strategies for the next presidential election, GIS is a very powerful tool. More important, GIS is about geography and learning about the world in which we live. As GIS techno logy develops, as society becomes ever more geospatially enabled, and as more and more people rediscover geography and the power of maps, the future uses and applications of GIS are unlimited. To take full advantage of the benefits of GIS and related geosp atial technology both now and in the future, it is useful to take stock of the ways in which we already think spatially with respect to the world in which we live. In other words, by recognizing and increasing our geographical awareness about how we relate to our local environment and the world at large, we will benefit more from our use and application of GIS. The purpose of this chapter is to increase our geographical awareness and to refine our spatial thinking. First, a simple mental mapping exercise is used to highlight our geographical knowledge and spatial awareness, or lack thereof. Second, fundamental concepts and terms that are central to geographic information systems, and more generally geography, are identified, defined, and explained. This chap ter Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 5 concludes with a description of the frameworks that guide the use and application of GIS, as well as its future development. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 6 1.1 Spatial Thinking LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1. The objective of this section is to illustrate how we think geographically every day with mental maps and to highlight the importance of asking geographic questions. At no other time in the history of the world has it been easier to create or to acquire a map of nearly anything. Maps and mapping technology are literally and virtually everywhere. Though the modes and means of making and distributing maps have been revolutionized with recent advances in computing like the Internet, the art and science of map making date back centuries. This is because humans are inherently spatial organi sms, and in order for us to live in the world, we must first somehow relate to it. Enter the mental map. Mental Maps Mental or cognitive maps are psychological tools that we all use every day. As the name suggests, mental maps are maps of our environment t hat are stored in our brain. We rely on our mental maps to get from one place to another, to plan our daily activities, or to understand and situate events that we hear about from our friends, family, or the news. Mental maps also reflect the amount and ex tent of geographic knowledge and spatial awareness that we possess. To illustrate this point, pretend that a friend is visiting you from out of town for the first time. Using a blank sheet of paper, take five to ten minutes to draw a map from memory of you r hometown that will help your friend get around. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org What did you choose to draw on your map? Is your house or where you work on the map? What about streets, restaurants, malls, museums, or other points of interest? How did you draw objects on your map? Did you use symbols, lines, and shapes? Are places labeled? Why did you choose to include certain places and features on your map but not others? What limitations did you encounter when making your map? This simple exercise is instructive for several reasons. First, it illustrates what you know about where you live. Your simple map is a rough approximation of your local geographic knowledge and mental map. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 8 Second, it highlights the way in which you relate to your local environment. What you choose to include and exclude on your map provides insights about what places you think are important and how you move through your place or residence. Third, if we were to compare your mental map to someone else’s from the same place, certain similarities emerge that shed l ight upon how we as humans tend to think spatially and organize geographical information in our minds. Fourth, this exercise reveals something about your artistic, creative, and cartographic abilities. In this respect, not only are mental maps unique, but also the way in which such maps are drawn or represented on the page is unique too. To reinforce these points, consider the series of mental maps of Los Angeles provided in Figure 1.1 "Mental Map of Los Angeles A" . Figure 1.1 Mental Map of Los Angeles A Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 9 Figure 1.2 Mental Map of Los Angeles B Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 10 Figure 1.3 Mental Map of Los Angeles C Take a moment to look at each map and compare the maps with the following questions in mind: • What similarities are there on each map? • What are some of the differences? • Which places or features are illustrated on the map? • From what you know about Los Angeles, what is included or excluded on the maps? • What assumptions are made in each map? • At what scale is the map drawn? Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 11 Each map is probably an imperfect representation of one’s mental map, but we can see some similarities and differences that provide insights into how people relate to Los Angeles, maps, and more generally, the world. First, all maps are oriented so that north is up. Though only one of the maps contains a north arrow that explicitly informs viewers the geographic orientation of the map, we are accustomed to most maps having north at the top of the page. Second, all but the first map identify some prominent features and landmarks in the Los Angeles area. For i nstance, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) appears on two of these maps, as do the Santa Monica Mountains. How the airport is represented or portrayed on the map, for instance, as text, an abbreviation, or symbol, also speaks to our experience using and understanding maps. Third, two of the maps depict a portion of the freeway network in Los Angeles, and one also highlights the Los Angeles River and Ballona Creek. In a city where the “car is king,” how can any map omit the freeways? What you include a nd omit on your map, by choice or not, speaks volumes about your geographical knowledge and spatial awareness— or lack thereof. Recognizing and identifying what we do not know is an important part of learning. It is only when we identify the unknown that we are able to ask questions, collect information to answer those questions, develop knowledge through answers, and begin to understand the world where we live. Asking Geographic Questions Filling in the gaps in our mental maps and, more generally, the gaps in our geographic knowledge requires us to ask questions about the world where we live and how we relate to it. Such questions can be simple with a local focus (e.g., “Which way is the nearest hospital?”) or more complex with a more global perspective (e.g ., “How is urbanization impacting biodiversity hotspots around the world?”). The thread that unifies such questions is geography. For instance, the question of “where?” is an essential part of the questions “Where is the nearest hospital?” and “Where are t he biodiversity hotspots in relation to cities?” Being able to articulate questions clearly and to break them into manageable pieces are very valuable skills when using and applying a geographic information system (GIS). Though there may be no such thing a s a “dumb” question, some questions are indeed better than others. Learning how to ask the right question takes practice and is often more difficult than finding the answer Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 12 itself. However, when we ask the right question, problems are more easily solved and our understanding of the world is improved. There are five general types of geographic questions that we can ask and that GIS can help us to answer. Each type of question is listed here and is also followed by a few examples (Nyerges 1991). [1] Questions about geographic location : • Where is it? • Why is it here or there? • How much of it is here or there? Questions about geographic distribution : • Is it distributed locally or globally? • Is it spatially clustered or dispersed? • Where are the boundaries? Questions about geographic association : • What else is near it? • What else occurs with it? • What is absent in its presence? Questions about geographic interaction : • Is it linked to something else? • What is the nature of this association? • How much interaction occurs between the locations? Questions about geographic change : • Has it always been here? • How has it changed over time and space? Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 13 • What causes its diffusion or contraction? These and related geographic questions are frequently asked by people from various areas of expertise, industries, and professions. For instance, urban planners, traffic engineers, and demographers may be interested in understanding the commuting patterns between cities and suburbs (geographic interaction). Biologists and botanists may be curiou s about why one animal or plant species flourishes in one place and not another (geographic location/distribution). Epidemiologists and public health officials are certainly interested in where disease outbreaks occur and how, why, and where they spread (g eographic change/interaction/location). A GIS can assist in answering all these questions and many more. Furthermore, a GIS often opens up additional avenues of inquiry when searching for answers to geographic questions. Herein is one of the greatest stren gths of the GIS. While a GIS can be used to answer specific questions or to solve particular problems, it often unearths even more interesting questions and presents more problems to be solved in the future. KEY TAKEAWAYS • Mental maps are psychological tools that we use to understand, relate to, and navigate through the environment in which we live, work, and play. • Mental maps are unique to the individual. • Learning how to ask geographic questions is important to using and applying GISs. • Geographic questions are concerned with location, distributions, associations, interactions, and change. EXERCISES 1. Draw a map of where you live. Discuss the similarities, differences, styles, and techniques on your map and compare them with two others. What are the commonalities between the maps? What are the differences? What accounts for such similarities and differences? 2. Draw a map of the world and compare it to a world map in an atlas. What similarities and differences are there? What explains the discrepancies b etween your map and the atlas? Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 14 3. Provide two questions concerned with geographic location, distribution, association, interaction, and change about global warming, urbanization, biodiversity, economic development, and war.

Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 15 1.2 Geographic Concepts LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1. The objective of this section is to introduce and explain how the key concepts of location, direction, distance, space, and navigation are relevant to geography and geographic information systems (GISs). Before we can learn “how to do” a geographic information system (GIS), it is first necessary to review and reconsider a few key geographic concepts that are often taken for granted. For instance, what is a location and how can it be defined? At what distance does a location become “nearby”? Or what do we mean when we say that someone has a “good sense of direction”? By answering these and related questions, we establish a framework that will help us to learn and to apply a GIS. This framework will also permit us to share and communicate geographic information with others, which can facilitate collaboration, problem solving, and decision making. Location The one concept that distinguishes geography from other fields is location, which is central to a GIS. Location is simply a position on the surface of the earth. What is more, nearly everything can be assigned a geographic location. Once we know the location of something, we can a put it on a map, for example, with a GIS. Generally, we tend to define and describe locations in nominal or absolute terms. In the case of the former, locations are simply defined and described by name. For example, city names such as New York, Tokyo, or London refer to nominal locations. Toponymy, or the study of place names and their respective history and meanings, is concerned with such nominal locations (Monmonier 1996, 2006). [1], [2] Though we tend to associate the notion of location with particular points on the surface of the earth, locations can also refer to geographic features (e.g., Rocky Mountains) or large areas (e.g., Siberia). The United States Board on Geographic Names ( http://geonames.usgs.gov ) maintains geographic naming standards and keeps track of such names through the Geographic Names Information Systems (GNIS; http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gn ispublic ). The GNIS database also provides information about which state and county the feature is located as well as its geographic coordinates. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 16 Contrasting nominal locations are absolute locations that use some type of reference system to define position s on the earth’s surface. For instance, defining a location on the surface of the earth using latitude and longitude is an example of absolute location. Postal codes and street addresses are other examples of absolute location that usually follow some form of local logic. Though there is no global standard when it comes to street addresses, we can determine the geographic coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) of particular street addresses, zip codes, place names, and other geographic data through a pr ocess called geocoding. There are several free online geocoders (e.g., http://worldkit.org/geocoder ) that return the latitude and longitude for various locations and addresses around the world. With the advent of the global positioning system (GPS) (see also http://www.gps.gov ), determining the location of nearly any object on the surface of the earth is a relatively simple and straightforward exercise. GPS technology consists of a constellation of twenty -four satellites that are orbiting the earth and constantly transmitting time signals (see Figure 1.4 "Constellation of Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellites" ). To determine a position, earth- based GP S units (e.g., handheld devices, car navigation systems, mobile phones) receive the signals from at least three of these satellites and use this information to triangulate a location. All GPS units use the geographic coordinate system (GCS) to report location. Originally developed by the United States Department of Defense for military purposes, there are now a wide range of commercial and scientific uses of a GPS. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 17 Figure 1.4 Constellation of Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellites Location can also be defined in relative terms. Relative location refers to defining and describing places in relation to other known locations. For instance, Cairo, Egypt, is north of Johannesburg, South Africa; New Zealand is southeast of Australia; and Kabul, Afghanistan , is northwest of Lahore, Pakistan. Unlike nominal or absolute locations that define single points, relative locations provide a bit more information and situate one place in relation to another. Direction Like location, the concept of direction is central to geography and GISs. Direction refers to the position of something relative to something else usually along a line. In order to determine direction, a reference point or benchmark from which direction will be measured needs to be established. One of the most common benchmarks used to determine direction is ourselves. Egocentric direction refers to when we use ourselves as a directional benchmark. Describing something as “to my left,” “behind me,” or “next to me” are examples of egocentric direction. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 18 As the name suggests, landmark direction uses a known landmark or geographic feature as a benchmark to determine direction. Such landmarks may be a busy intersection of a city, a prominent point of interest like the Colosseum in Rome, or some other feature lik e a mountain range or river. The important thing to remember about landmark direction, especially when providing directions, is that the landmark should be relatively well -known. In geography and GISs, there are three more standard benchmarks that are used to define the directions of true north, magnetic north, and grid north. True north is based on the point at which the axis of the earth’s rotation intersects the earth’s surface. In this respect the North and South Poles serve as the geographic benchmarks for determining direction. Magnetic north (and south) refers to the point on the surface of the earth where the earth’s magnetic fields converge. This is also the point to which magnetic compasses point. Note that magnetic north falls somewhere in norther n Canada and is not geographically coincident with true north or the North Pole. Grid north simply refers to the northward direction that the grid lines of latitude and longitude on a map, called a graticule, point to. Figure 1.5 The Three Norths: True, Ma gnetic, and Grid Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 19 Source: http://kenai.fws.gov/overview/notebook/2004/sept/3sep2004.htm Distance Complementing the concepts of location and direction is distance. Distance refers to the degree or amount of separation between locations and can be measured in nominal or absolute terms with various units. We can describe the distances between locations n ominally as “large” or “small,” or we can describe two or more locations as “near” or “far apart.” Absolute distance is measured or calculated using a standard metric. The formula for the distance between two points on a planar (i.e., flat) surface is the following: D=(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√ Calculating the distance between two locations on the surface of the earth, ho wever, is a bit more involved because we are dealing with a three- dimensional object. Moving from the three -dimensional earth to two - dimensional maps on paper, computer screens, and mobile devices is not a trivial matter and is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 2 "Map Anatomy" . We also use a variety of units to measure distance. For instance, the distance between London and Singapore can be measured in miles, kilometers, flight time on a jumbo jet, or days on a cargo ship. Whether or not such distances make London and Singapore “near” or “far” from each other is a matter of opinion, experience, and patience. Hence the use of absolute distance metrics, such as that derived from the distance formula, provide a standardized method to measure how far away o r how near locations are from each other. Space Where distance suggests a measurable quantity in terms of how far apart locations are situated, space is a more abstract concept that is more commonly described rather than measured. For example, space can be described as “empty,” “public,” or “private.” Within the scope of a GIS, we are interested in space, and in particular, we are interested in what fills particular spaces and how and why things are distributed across space. In this sense, space is a somewh at ambiguous and generic term that is used to denote the general geographic area of interest. Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 20 One kind of space that is of particular relevance to a GIS is topological space. Simply put, topological space is concerned with the nature of relationships and t he connectivity of locations within a given space. What is important within topological space are (1) how locations are (or are not) related or connected to each other and (2) the rules that govern such geographic relationships. Transportation maps such as those for subways provide some of the best illustrations of topological spaces (see Figure 1.6 "Metro Map from London" and Figure 1.7 "Metro Map from Moscow" ). When using such maps, we are primarily concerned with how to get from one stop to another along a transportation network. Certain rules also govern how we can travel along the network (e.g., transferring lines is possible only at a few key stops; we can travel only one direction on a particular line). Such maps may be of little use when traveling ar ound a city by car or foot, but they show the local transportation network and how locations are linked together in an effective and efficient manner. Figure 1.6 Metro Map from London Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 21 Figure 1.7 Metro Map from Moscow Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 22 Navigation Transportation maps like those discussed previously illustrate how we move through the environments where we live, work, and play. This movement and, in particular, destination -oriented travel are generally referred to as navigation. How we navigate through space is a complex pro cess that blends together our various motor skills; technology; mental maps; and awareness of locations, distances, directions, and the space where we live (Golledge and Stimson 1997). [3] What is more, our geographical knowledge and spatial awareness is c ontinuously updated and changed as we move from one location to another. The acquisition of geographic knowledge is a lifelong endeavor. Though several factors influence the nature of such knowledge, we tend to rely on the three following types of geograph ic knowledge when navigating through space: 1. Landmark knowledge refers to our ability to locate and identify unique points, patterns, or features (e.g., landmarks) in space. 2. Route knowledge permits us to connect and travel between landmarks by moving throug h space. 3. Survey knowledge enables us to understand where landmarks are in relation to each other and to take shortcuts. Each type of geographic knowledge is acquired in stages, one after the other. For instance, when we find ourselves in a new or an unfami liar location, we usually identify a few unique points of interest (e.g., hotel, building, fountain) to orient ourselves. We are in essence building up our landmark knowledge. Using and traveling between these landmarks develops our route knowledge and rei nforces our landmark knowledge and our overall geographical awareness. Survey knowledge develops once we begin to understand how routes connect landmarks together and how various locations are situated in space. It is at this point, when we are somewhat co mfortable with our survey knowledge, that we are able to take shortcuts from one location to another. Though there is no guarantee that a shortcut will be successful, if we get lost, we are at least expanding our local geographic knowledge. Landmark, route, and survey knowledge are the cornerstones of having a sense of direction and frame our geographical learning and awareness. While some would argue that they are born with a good sense of direction, others admit to always getting lost. The popularity of personal navigation devices and online Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 23 mapping services speaks to the overwhelming desire to know and to situate where we are in the world. Though developing and maintaining a keen sense of direction presumably matters less and less as such devices and services continue to develop and spread, it can also be argued that the more we know about where we are in the world, the more we will want to learn about it. This section covers concepts essential to geography, GISs, and many other fields of interest. Understanding how location, direction, and distance can be defined and described provides an important foundation for the successful use and i
