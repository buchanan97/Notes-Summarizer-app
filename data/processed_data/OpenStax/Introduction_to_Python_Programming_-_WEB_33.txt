facts about ho w Python was first cr eated. Describe two ways Python is consider ed a popular language. Historical backgr ound Python has an inter esting history . In 1982, Guido van Rossum (https: openstax.or g r 100van Rossum) , the creator of Python, started working at CWI (https: openstax.or g r CWI) , a Dutch national r esear ch institute. He joined a team that was designing a ne w pr ogramming language, named ABC, for teaching and pr ototyping. ABC' s simplicity was ideal for beginners, but the language lacked featur es requir ed to write advanced programs. Several years later , van Rossum joined a differ ent team at CWI working on an oper ating system. The team needed an easier way to write pr ograms for monitoring computers and analyzing data. Languages common in the 1980' s wer e (and still ar e) difficult to use for these kinds of pr ograms. van Rossum envisioned a ne w language that would have a simple syntax, like ABC, but also pr ovide advanced featur es that pr ofessionals would need. At first, van Rossum started working on this ne w language as a hobb y during his fr ee time. He named the language Python because he was a fan of the British comedy gr oup Monty Python (https: openstax.or g r Monty Python) . Over the ne xt year , he and his colleagues successfully used Python many times for r eal work. van Rossum e ventually decided to shar e Python with the br oader pr ogramming community online. He freely shar ed Python 's entir e sour ce code so that anyone could
