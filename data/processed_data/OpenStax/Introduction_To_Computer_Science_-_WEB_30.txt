computer scientists gr owing desir e to serve not only mor e engaged students, but also a mor e engaged public in making sense of the values of computer technologies. The Capabilities and Limitations of Computer Science Computers can be understood as sour ces, tools, and opportunities for changing social conditions. Many people have used computer science to achie ve diverse goals be yond this dominant vision for computer science. For e xample, consider computers in education. Around the same time that the ARP ANET began de velopment in the late 1960s, W ally Feurzeig, Se ymour Papert, and Cynthia Solomon designed the L OGO programming language to enable ne w kinds of computermediated e xpression and communication. Compar ed to contempor ary pr ogramming languages such as FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation System) that emphasized computation to ward scientific and engineering applications, L OGO is well kno wn for its use of turtle gr aphics, wher eby programs wer e used to contr ol the actions of a digital turtle using instructions such as mo ving forwar d some number of units and turning left or right some number of degr ees. Papert ar gued that this turtle pr ogramming enabled body-syntonic r easoning , a kind of e xperience that could help students mor e effectively learn concepts in mathematics such as angles, distance, and geometric shapes b y instructing the turtle to dr aw them, and physics b y constructing their o wn understandings via r easoning thr ough the physical motion of turtle pr ograms b y sho wing concepts of velocity , repeated commands to mo ve forwar d the same amount; acceler ation, b y making
