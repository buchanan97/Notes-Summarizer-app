pr ovide a holistic appr oach to learning that e xtends be yond theory . With a forwar d-looking perspective, Introduction to Computer Science pr epar es students to engage with advanced topics in computer science, such as machine learning, cybersecurity , and cloud computing, ensuring the y have a solid foundation for continued study and futur e professional success. Coverage and Scope The authors and contributors consulted with other educators and industry pr ofessionals fr om a r ange of institutions and or ganizations in or der to ensur e that Introduction to Computer Science meets the diverse needs of both computer science majors and non-majors. The book is structur ed into five main parts, each focusing on critical ar eas of the discipline: Part : Pr oblem Solving and Algorithms This section intr oduces students to the foundations of computer science, focusing on computational thinking, pr oblem-solving techniques, and algorithm design. T opics include data structur es, formal pr operties of algorithms, and algorithmic par adigms. Through pr actical e xamples and e xercises, students will de velop the skills needed to construct and analyze algorithms and understand their applications acr oss various domains. Part : Realizations of Algorithms In this part, students e xplor e ho w algorithms ar e realized in har dwar e and softwar e, starting with lo w-level pr ogramming languages and mo ving into har dwar e design and computer systems or ganization. Students will learn about models of computation, machine-le vel representation, pr ocessor ar chitectur es, and memory hier archy. This foundational understanding enables students to see the connections between abstr act algorithms and their physical implementations. Part : Designing
