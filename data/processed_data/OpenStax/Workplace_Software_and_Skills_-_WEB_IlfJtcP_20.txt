o ver , pounds, about times the aver age laptop today . The Z1 contained many of the internal components still used in today s computers, paving the way for other inventors to e volve the technology . Bill He wlett and David Packar d, two Stanfor d University engineering students, began working out of a gar age in California, initially de veloping equipment for engineers and major companies. The y founded their company , Hewlett Packar d (HP) , in 1939, but it wasn t until a fe w decades later that it would become a titan in the computer manufacturing industry . Meanwhile, the 1940s and 1950s saw major advances in computing technology . Most notable was the 1943 invention of the ENIA C (Electr onic Numerical Integr ator and Calculator) . This massive unit, built b y two professors at the University of Pennsylvania, is consider ed the for erunner of today s digital computers because it was the first machine to run calculations electr onically . Other inno vations included solving equations simultaneously and the invention of the tr ansistor , which allo wed for much smaller computers to be built. The de velopment of computer language is another major milestone in computing history . By using wor ds rather than symbols, computer coding became easier to learn and write, especially for those in the business world who did not have mathematics or engineering degr ees. It is thanks, in lar ge part, to mathematician and U.S. Navy Admir al Gr ace Hopper ( Figur e ). Hopper s Ph D in mathematics fr om Y ale, along with her naval career working on technology to
