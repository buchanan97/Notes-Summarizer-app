Logarithms pr ovided a shortcut for making tedious calculations and became the foundation for multiple analog calculating machines invented during the 1600s. Scientists continued to e xplor e differ ent ways to speed up or automate calculations. In the 1820s, English mathematician Charles Babbage invented the Differ ence Engine with the goal of pr eventing human err ors in manual calculations. The Differ ence Engine pr ovided a means to automate the calculations of polynomial functions and astr onomical calculations. Babbage follo wed the Differ ence Engine with his invention of the Analytical Engine . With assistance fr om Ada Lovelace, the Analytical Engine was pr ogram-contr olled and included featur es like an integr ated memory and an arithmetic logic unit. Lo velace used punched car ds to cr eate sequencing instructions that could be r ead b y the Analytical Engine to automatically perform any calculation included in the pr ogramming code.
