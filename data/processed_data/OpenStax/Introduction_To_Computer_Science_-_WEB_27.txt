The algorithmic principles that determine ho w results ar e computed makes up softwar e. Almost all computers, fr om the ENIA C to today s computers, ar e consider ed Turing-complete (or Computationally Universal, as opposed to specialized computing de vices such as scientific calculators) because they shar e the same fundamental model for computing r esults and e very computer has the ability to run any algorithm . Alan Mathison T uring was an English mathematician who was highly influential in the de velopment of theor etical computer science, which focuses on the mathematical pr ocesses behind softwar e, and pr ovided a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the T uring machine. A T uring-complete computer stor es data in memory (either using vacuum tubes or silicon) and manipulates that data accor ding to a computer pr ogram, which is an algorithm that can be run on a computer . These pr ograms ar e represented using symbols and instructions written in a programming language consisting of symbols and instructions that can be interpr eted b y the computer . Programs ar e also stor ed in memory , which allo ws programmers to modify and impr ove pr ograms b y changing the instructions. While both har dwar e and softwar e are important to the pr actical oper ation of computers, computer science s historical r oots in mathematics also emphasize a thir d perspective. Wher eas softwar e focuses on the pr ogram details for solving pr oblems with computers,
