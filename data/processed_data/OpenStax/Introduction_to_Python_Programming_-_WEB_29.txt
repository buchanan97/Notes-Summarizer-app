earlier e xample, but the code contains se veral mistakes. One line is missing r equir ed punctuation, and another line uses incorr ect symbols. Run the pr ogram to find the first err or, and corr ect the corr esponding line of code. Keep running and corr ecting the pr ogram until no err ors ar e found.

Write a docstring (mor e verbose comment) that describes the pr ogram functionality . The hash char acter Comments are short phr ases that e xplain what the code is doing. Ex: Lines , , and in the follo wing program contain comments. Each comment begins with a hash char acter ( ). All te xt from the hash char acter to the end of the line is ignor ed when running the pr ogram. In contr ast, hash char acters inside of strings ar e treated as r egular te xt. Ex: The string "Item : " does not contain a comment. When writing comments: The char acter should be follo wed b y a single space. Ex: End of menu is easier to r ead than End of menu. Comments should e xplain the purpose of the code, not just r epeat the code itself . Ex: Get the user's preferences is mor e descriptive than Input item1 and item2 .
