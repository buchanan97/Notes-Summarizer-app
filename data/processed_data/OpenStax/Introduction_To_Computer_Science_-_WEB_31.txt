In this way , computers could not only be used to further education in computer science , but also offer ne w, mor e dynamic ways to learn other subjects. Papert s ideas have been e xpanded be yond the r ealm of mathematics and physics to ar eas such as the social sciences, wher e inter active data visualization can help students identify inter esting corr elations and patterns that pr ecipitated social change and turning points in history while also learning ne w data fluencies and the limits of data-based appr oaches. Yet despite these r oots in aspir ations for computers as a medium for learning anything and e verything, the study of computer science education emer ged in the 1970s as a field narr owly concerned with pr oducing mor e effective softwar e engineers.
