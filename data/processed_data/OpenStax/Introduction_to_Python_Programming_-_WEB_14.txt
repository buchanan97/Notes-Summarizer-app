. Leading tech giants like Google, Apple, NASA, Instagr am, Pixar , and others use Python e xtensively . One r eason why Python is popular is because many libr aries e xist for doing r eal work. A libraryis a collection of code that can be used in other pr ograms. Python comes with an e xtensive Standar d Libr ary (https: openstax.or g r 100p ythlibr ary) for solving e veryday computing pr oblems like e xtracting data fr om files and cr eating summary r eports. In addition, the community de velops many other libr aries for Python. Ex: Pandas (https: openstax.or g r 100pandas) is a widely used libr ary for data analysis. Another r eason why Python is popular is because the syntax is concise and str aightforwar d. The syntax of a language defines ho w code must be structur ed. Syntax rules define the ke ywor ds, symbols, and formatting used in pr ograms. Compar ed to other pr ogramming languages, Python is mor e concise and str aightforwar d. EXAMPLE Hello world in P ython and Ja va By tr adition, Hello W orld (https: openstax.or g r 100hello world) is the first pr ogram to write when learning a ne w language. This pr ogram simply displays the message "Hello, World!" to the user . The hello world program is only one line in Python: print("Hello, World!" ) In contr ast, the hello world pr ogram is five lines in Java (a differ ent language). public class Hello public static void main(String args) System.out.println("Hello, World!"); However, conciseness is not the only consider ation for which language is used.
