When someone designs a computer system, the y are thinking about what kinds of programs people might want to run. T ypically , effort is made to design the computer system so it is mor e efficient at running certain kinds of pr ograms. A computer optimized for calculating missile tr ajectories, for example, won t be optimized for running social media apps. Many computing inno vations wer e initially de veloped for military r esear ch and communication purposes, including the pr edecessor to the Internet, the ARPANET (Figur e ). S. Golomb, Richar d E.
