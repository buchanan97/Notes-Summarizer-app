Despite advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) , computer functions that perform tasks, such as visual per ception and decision-making pr ocesses that usually are performed b y human intelligence, these pr oblems r emain be yond our collective r each due to the inher ent unpr edictability and comple xity of certain natur al systems. Theor etical computer science is often emphasized in under graduate computer science pr ograms because academic computer science emer ged fr om mathematics, often to the detriment of perspectives that center on the social and technical values embodied b y applications of computer technology . These perspectives, however, are gradually changing. Just as the design of ARPANET shaped the design of the Internet, computer scientists ar e also learning that the physical aspects of computer hardwar edetermine what can be efficiently computed. For e xample, many of today s artificial intelligence technologies r ely on highly specialized computer hardwar e that is fundamentally differ ent at the physical le vel compar ed to the gener al-purpose pr ogrammable silicon that has been the tr aditional focus of computer science.

Computer science education is another subfield that emphasizes the cognitive, social, and communal aspects of learning computer science.
