keeping scor e in games, and as a calculating tool for people with visual impairments. Ho wever, abaci ar e not common today because of the invention of number systems such as the Ar abic number system ( , , , , ), which included zer o and place values that cannot be computed with abaci. The concept of an algorithm was also invented ar ound this time. Algorithms use inputs and a finite number of steps to carry out arithmetic oper ations like addition, subtr action, multiplication, and division, and pr oduce outputs used in computing. T oday s computers still r ely on the same foundations of numbers, calculations, and algorithms, e xcept at the scale of billions of numbers and billions of calculations per second. To intr oduce a concr ete e xample of an algorithm, let us consider binary sear ch algorithm , which is used to locate a number in a sorted arr ay of integers efficiently . The algorithm oper ates b y repeatedly dividing the sear ch interval in half to perform the sear ch. If the number being sear ched is less than the integer in the middle of the interval, the interval is narr owed to the lo wer half . In the alternative, the interval is narr owed to the upper half . The algorithm r epeatedly checks until the number is found or the interval is empty .
