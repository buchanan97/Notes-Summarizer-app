Analytical Engine, Lo velace became the world s first computer pr ogrammer . The ne xt major de velopment in computing occurr ed in the late 1800s when Herman Hollerith, an emplo yee of the U .S. Census Office, de veloped a machine that could punch car ds and count them. In 1890, Hollerith s invention was used to tabulate and pr epar e statistics for the U .S. census. By the end of the 1800s and leading into the early 1900s, calculators, adding machines, type writers, and related machines became mor e commonplace, setting the stage for the invention of the computer . In the 1940s, multiple computers became available, including IBM s Harvar d Mark . These wer e the for erunners to the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s, which changed e verything and e volved into the computers and r elated technology we have today . Around this time, computer science emer ged as an academic discipline r ooted in the principles of mathematics, situated primarily in elite institutions, and funded b y demand fr om the military for use in missile guidance systems, airplanes, and other military applications. As computers could e xecute pr ograms faster than humans, computer science r eplaced human-po wered calculation with computer-po wered pr oblemsolving methods. In this way , the earliest academic computer scientists envisioned computer science as a discipline that was far mor e intellectual and cognitive compar ed to the manual calculation work that pr eceded it. Computer Science Richar d Bellman was a significant contributor to this effort. A mathematics pr ofessor at Princeton and later at Stanfor d in the 1940s, Bellman later
