do, as well as what it should not do The field of computer science (CS) is the study of computing , which includes all phenomena r elated to computers, such as the Internet. With foundations in engineering and mathematics, computer science focuses on studying algorithms. An algorithm is a sequence of pr ecise instructions that enables computing. This includes components computers use to pr ocess information. By studying and applying algorithms, computer science cr eates applications and solutions that impact all ar eas of society . For e xample, computer science developed the pr ograms that enable online shopping, te xting with friends, str eaming music, and other technological pr ocesses. While computers ar e common today , the y wer en t always this pervasive. For those whose lives have been shaped b y computer technology , it can sometimes seem like computer technology is ahistorical: computing often focuses on r apid inno vation and impr ovement, wasting no time looking back and r eflecting on the past. Yet the foundations of computer science defined o ver , and as much as , years ago very much shape what is possible with computing today . The Early History of Computing The first computing de vices wer e not at all like the computers we kno w today . The y wer e physical calculation devices such as the abacus , which first appear ed in many societies acr oss the world thousands of years ago. They allo wed people to tally , count, or add numbers ( Figur e ). Today , abaci ar e still used in some situations, such as helping small childr en learn basic arithmetic,
