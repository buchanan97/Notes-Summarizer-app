Their accomplishments include leading computer stor es and de veloping early Internet social media platforms, ne ws, and blog websites. For e xample, Ro y L. Clay Sr ., a member of the Silicon V alley Engineering Hall of Fame, helped He wlett-Packar d de velop its first computer lab and cr eate the company s first computers. Later , Clay pr ovided information to ventur e capitalists that motivated them to invest in start-ups such as Intel and Compaq. In another e xample, Mark Dean was an engineer for IBM whose work was instrumental in helping IBM de velop the Industry Standar d Architectur e (ISA) bus, which cr eated a method of connecting a computer sprocessor with other components and enabling them to communicate.
