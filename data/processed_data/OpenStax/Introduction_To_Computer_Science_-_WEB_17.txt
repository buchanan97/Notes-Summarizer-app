oss the Disciplines Computer Science and the Futur e of Society Introduction This te xtbook will intr oduce you to the e xciting and comple x world of computer science. In this chapter , you ll review the history of computer science, learn about its use in differ ent fields, and e xplor e ho w computer science will impact the futur e of society . Computer science is a po werful tool, and computer scientists have used their vast kno wledge of technology to cr eate and implement technology that has tr ansformed societies around the world. This book will also intr oduce the computational thinking aspects of pr oblem-solving and analytical thinking that enable the study of algorithms, which ar e step-b y-step instructions for solving specific pr oblems or carrying out computations. Ther efore, this book also co vers algorithms and their r ealization via pr ogramming languages, computer systems ar chitectur es, networks, and oper ating systems. The book subsequently delves into computer science ar eas that enable the design and de velopment of softwar e solutions using high-le vel programming languages (i.e., coding languages designed to be mor e intuitive for humans), ar chitectur al styles and r elated models, data management systems, and softwar e engineering. Finally , the book demonstr ates how to le verage computer science r ealizations and ar eas to build modern end-to-end solutions to business and social pr oblems. In particular , the book focuses on modern web applications de velopment, cloud-native applications de velopment, and hybrid Cloud on-pr emise digital solutions. The various chapters emphasize how to achie ve softwar e solution qualities such as performance and scalability
