was completed in 1945, making it one of the earliest digital computers. The ENIA C oper ated on differ ent physical principles. Instead of silicon, the ENIA C used the technology of a vacuum tube , a physical device like a light bulb that was used as memory in early digital computers. When the light in the vacuum tube is off , the vacuum tube r epresents the number . When the light is on, the vacuum tube r epresents the number . When thousands of vacuum tubes ar e combined in a logical way , we suddenly have memory . The ENIA C is notable in computer history because it was the first gener al-purpose computer , meaning that it could run not just a single pr ogram but r ather any pr ogram specified b y a pr ogrammer . The ENIA C was often run and pr ogrammed b y women pr ogrammers ( Figur e ). Despite its age and differ ences in har dwar e properties, it shar es a fundamental and surprising similarity with modern computers. Anything that can be computed on1. Computer Science today s computers can also be computed b y the ENIA C given the right cir cumstances just trillions of times more slo wly. Figur e1. This image depicts women pr ogrammers holding boar ds used in computers such as the ENIA C, many of which wer e designed e xpressly for ballistics and or dinance guidance r esear ch.
