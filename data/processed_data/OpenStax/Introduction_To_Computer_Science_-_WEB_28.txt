theor etical computer science focuses on the mathematical processes behind softwar e. The idea of T uring-completeness is a foundational concept in theor etical computer science, which considers ho w computers in gener al not just the ENIA Cor today s computers, but e ven tomorr ow s computers that we haven t yet invented can solve pr oblems. This theor etical perspective e xpands computer science kno wledge b y contributing ideas about ( ) whether a pr oblem can be computed b y a T uringcomplete computer at all, ( ) ho w that pr oblem might be computed using an algorithm, and ( ) ho w quickly or efficiently a computer can run such an algorithm. The answers to these questions suggest the limits of what we can achie ve with computers fr om a technical perspective: Using mathematical ideas, is it possible to use a computer to compute all pr oblems? If the answer to a pr oblem is yes, ho w much of a computing r esour ce is needed to get the answer? Clearly both humans and computers have their str engths and limitations. An e xample of a pr oblem that humans can solve but computers struggle with is interpr eting subtle emotions or making mor al judgments in comple x social situations. While computers can pr ocess data and r ecognize patterns, the y cannot fully understand the nuances of human emotions or ethics, which often involve conte xt, empathy , and e xperience.
