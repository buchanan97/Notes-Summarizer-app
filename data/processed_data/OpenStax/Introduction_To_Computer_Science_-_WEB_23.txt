went to work for the Rand Corpor ation, wher e he studied the theory of multistage decision pr ocesses. In 1953, Bellman invented dynamic pr ogramming ,1which is a mathematical optimization methodology and a technique for computer pr ogramming. With dynamic pr ogramming, comple x problems ar e divided into mor e manageable subpr oblems. Each subpr oblem is solved, and the r esults ar e stored, ultimately r esulting in a solution to the o verall comple x problem. With this appr oach, Bellman helped revolutionize computer pr ogramming and enable computer science to become a r obust field. What Is Computer Science? The term computer science was popularized b y Geor ge E. Forsythe in 1961. A mathematician who founded Stanfor d University s computer science department, Forsythe defined computer science as the theory of programming, numerical analysis, data pr ocessing, and the design of computer systems. He also ar gued that computer science was distinguished fr om other disciplines b y the emphasis on algorithms, which ar e essential for effective computer pr ogramming. Computer science is not only about the study of ho w computers work, but also e verything surr ounding computers, including the people who design computers, the people who write pr ograms that run on computers, the people who test the pr ograms to ensur e corr ectness, and the people who ar e dir ectly and indir ectly affected b y computers. In this way , computer science is as much about people and ho w the y work with computers as it is about just computers. Not e veryone agr ees with this definition. Some people ar gue that computer science
