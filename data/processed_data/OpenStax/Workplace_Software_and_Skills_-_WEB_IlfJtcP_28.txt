copiers automated inventory systems Industries that ar e traditionally consider ed nontechnical have also embr aced impr ovements that depend on computing technology for e xample, farmers can contr ol irrigation and monitor field conditions. Computing technologies have also enabled individuals to embark on entr epreneurial ventur es that once only seemed like a dream and have launched some of them into marketplace leadership. Fr om manufacturing to health car e to the service sector , we can see the impact of computing and ho w technological inno vations continue to shape the futur e of many industries. For e xample, consider the auto industry , wher e advances in technology continue to pave the way for changes in ho w we drive, safety impr ovements, and ne w ways to pur chase vehicles. Recent inno vations include the introduction of self-driving vehicles (see Google s self-driving car ,Waymo in Figur e ) and of vehicle-to-vehicle communication cr oss-communication that allo ws cars to wir elessly shar e information such as speed, spatial proximity to other cars or objects, and tr affic status, with the potential to r educe vehicle cr ashes and congestion on r oadways. T echnology has also cr eated a space for nontr aditional car dealers, such as Carvana, that offer an online pur chase e xperience and home delivery . The use of technology in the auto industry can be seen at all stages of the business cycle. Figur e1. Google s Waymo, a self-driving car , can navigate r oads, maintain safe speeds, and see obstacles in time to apply the brakes. (cr edit: Google Self-Driving Car by R Boed Flickr , CC BY
