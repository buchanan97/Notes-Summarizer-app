science. All computers ar e made of physical, r ealworld material that we r efer to as hardwar e. Har dwar e which has four components, including pr ocessor , memory , network, and stor age is the computer component that enables computations. The processor can be regar ded as the computer s br ain, as it follo ws instructions fr om algorithms and pr ocesses data. The memory is a means of addr essing information in a computer b y storing it in consistent locations, while the network refers to the various technological de vices that ar e connected and shar e information. The har dwar e and physical components of a computer that permanently house a computer s data ar e called stor age. One way to understand computers is fr om a har dwar e perspective: computers le verage digital electr onics and the physics of materials used to de velop tr ansistors. For e xample, many of today s computers r ely on the physical pr operties of a brittle, crystalline metalloid called silicon, which makes it suitable for r epresenting information. The batteries that po wer many of today s smartphones and mobile de vices r ely on lithium, a soft, silvery metal mostly harvested fr om miner als in Austr alia, Zimbab we, and Br azil, as well as fr om continental brine deposits in Chile, Ar gentina, and Bolivia. Computer engineers combine these substances to build circuitry and information pathways at the micr oscopic scale to form the physical basis for modern computers. However, the physical basis of computers was not always silicon. The Electr onic Numerical Integr ator and Computer (ENIA C)
