STRING MANIPULATION, GUESS -and-CHECK, APPROXIMATIONS, BISECTION (download slides and . pyfiles ĂŶĚ follow along!) 6.0001 LECTURE 3 6.0001 LECTURE 3 1 LAST TIME strings branching –if/elif/else while loops for loops 6.0001 LECTURE 3 2 TODAY string manipulation guess and check algorithms approximate solutions bisection method 6.0001 LECTURE 3 3 STRINGS think of as a sequence of case sensitive characters can compare strings with ==, >, < etc . len()is a function used to retrieve the length of the string in the parentheses s = "abc" len(s) evaluates to 3 6.0001 LECTURE 3 4 STRINGS square brackets used to perform indexing into a string to get the value at a certain index/position s = "abc" s[0] evaluates to "a" s[1] evaluates to "b" s[2] evaluates to "c" s[3] trying to index out of bounds, error s[-1] evaluates to "c" s[-2] evaluates to "b" s[-3] evaluates to "a" 6.0001 LECTURE 3 5index : 0 1 2 indexing always starts at 0 index : -3 -2 -1 last element always at index -1 STRINGS can slice strings using [start:stop:step ] if give two numbers, [ start:stop ], step=1 by default you can also omit numbers and leave just colons 6.0001 LECTURE 3 6s = "abcdefgh " s[3:6] evaluates to "def", same ass[3:6:1] s[3:6:2]evaluates to "df" s[::] evaluates to "abcdefgh ", same as s[0:len(s):1] s[::-1]evaluates to "hgfedbca ", same as s[-1:-(len(s)+1): -1] s[4:1:-2]evaluates to "ec" STRINGS strings are “ immutable ” –cannot be modified s = "hello" s[0] = 'y' gives an error s = 'y'+s[1:len(s)] is allowed, s bound to new object 6.0001 LECTURE 3 7s"hello" "yello" for LOOPS RECAP for loops have a loop variable that iterates over a set of values for varin range(4): var iterates over values 0,1,2,3 <expressions> expressions inside loop executed with each value for var for varin range(4,6): var iterates over values 4,5 <expressions> range is a way to iterate over numbers, but a for loop variable can iterate over any set of values , not just numbers! 6.0001 LECTURE 3 8 STRINGS AND LOOPS these two code snippets do the same thing bottom one is more “ pythonic ” s = "abcdefgh " for index in range( len(s)): if s[index] == ' i' or s[index] == 'u': print("There is an ior u") for char in s: if char == ' i' or char == 'u': print("There is an ior u") 6.0001 LECTURE 3 9 CODE EXAMPLE: ROBOT CHEERLEADERS an_letters = "aefhilmnorsxAEFHILMNORSX " word = input("I will cheer for you! Enter a word: ") times = int(input("Enthusiasm level (1 -10): ")) i= 0 while i< len(word): char = word[ i] if char in an_letters : print("Give me an " + char + "! " + char) else: print("Give me a " + char + "! " + char) i+= 1 print("What does that spell ?") for iin range(times): print(word , "!!!") 6.0001 LECTURE 3 10for char in word: EXERCISE s1 = "mitu rock" s2 = "irule mit" if len(s1) == len(s2): for char1 in s1: for char2 in s2: if char1 == char2: print("common letter") break 6.0001 LECTURE 3 11 GUESS -AND -CHECK the process below also called exhaustive enumeration given a problem… you are able to guess a value for solution you are able to check if the solution is correct keep guessing until find solution or guessed all values 6.0001 LECTURE 3 12 GUESS -AND -CHECK –cube root cube = 8 for guess in range(cube+1): if guess**3 == cube: print("Cube root of", cube, "is", guess) 6.0001 LECTURE 3 13 GUESS -AND -CHECK –cube root cube = 8 for guess in range(abs(cube)+1): if guess**3 >= abs(cube): break if guess**3 != abs(cube): print(cube , 'is not a perfect cube') else: if cube < 0: guess = -guess print('Cube root of '+str(cube)+' is '+str(guess)) 6.0001 LECTURE 3 14 APPROXIMATE SOLUTIONS good enough solution start with a guess and increment by some small value keep guessing if |guess3-cube| >= epsilon for some small epsilon decreasing increment size slower program increasing epsilon less accurate answer 6.0001 LECTURE 3 15 APPROXIMATE SOLUTION –cube root cube = 27 epsilon = 0.01 guess = 0.0 increment = 0.0001 num_guesses = 0 while abs(guess** 3 -cube) >= epsilon: guess += increment num_guesses += 1 print('num_guesses =', num_guesses ) if abs(guess** 3 -cube) >= epsilon: print('Failed on cube root of', cube) else: print(guess, 'is close to the cube root of', cube)and guess <= cube : 6.0001 LECTURE 3 16 BISECTION SEARCH half interval each iteration new guess is halfway in between to illustrate, let’s play a game! 6.0001 LECTURE 3 17GUESS GUESS GUESS BISECTION SEARCH –cube root cube= 27 epsilon = 0.01 num_guesses = 0 low = 0 high = cube guess = (high + low )/2.0 while abs(guess**3 -cube) >= epsilon: if guess**3 < cube : low = guess else: high = guess guess = (high + low)/2.0 num_guesses += 1 print 'num_guesses =', num_guesses print guess, 'is close to the cube root of', cube 6.0001 LECTURE 3 18 BISECTION SEARCH CONVERGENCE search space ◦first guess: N/2 ◦second guess: N/4 ◦kth guess: N/2k guess converges on the order of log2Nsteps bisection search works when value of function varies monotonically with input code as shown only works for positive cubes > 1 –why? challenges modify to work with negative cubes! modify to work with x < 1! 6.0001 LECTURE 3 19 x< 1 if x < 1, search space is 0 to x but cube root is greater than x and less than 1 modify the code to choose the search space depending on value of x 6.0001 LECTURE 3 20 MIT OpenCourseWare https://ocw.mit.edu 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python Fall 2016 For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https:// ocw.mit.edu/terms .
