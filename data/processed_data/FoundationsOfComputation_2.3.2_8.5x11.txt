If youknowthatallhumansaremortal, andyouknowthatyouareh uman, thenin a sense you know that you are mortal, whether or not you have ev er considered or wanted to consider that fact. This is an example of logical deduction : From the premises that “All humans are mortal” and “I am human,” the conclusion that “I am mortal” can be deduced by logic. Logical deduction is a kind of computation. By applying rule s of logic to a given set of premises, conclusions that follow from those p remises can be generated automatically, by a computational process which could be carried out by a computer. Once you know the premises, or are willing to ac cept them for the sake of argument, you are forced—by logic—to accept the con clusions. Still, to say that you “know” those conclusions would be misleading . The problem is that there are too many of them (inﬁnitely many), and, in gene ral, most of them are not particularly interesting. Until you have actually m ade the deduction, you don’t reallyknow the conclusion, and knowing which of the possible chain s of deduction to follow is not easy. The artof logic is to ﬁnd an interesting conclusion and a chain of logical deductions that leads from the premises to that conclusion. Checking that the deductions are valid is t he mechanical, computational side of logic. This chapter is mostly about the mechanics of logic. We will i nvestigate logic as a branch of mathematics, with its own symbols, formu las, and rules of computation. Your object is to learn the rules of logic, to understand why they are valid, and to develop skill in applying them. As with any branch of mathematics, there is a certain beauty to the symbols and for mulas themselves. But it is the applications that bring the subject to life for m ost people. We will, of course, cover some applications as we go along. In a sense, though, the real applications of logic include much of computer science and o f mathematics itself. Among the fundamental elements of thought, and therefore of logic, are propositions. A proposition is a statement that has a truth value: It is either 2 CHAPTER 1. LOGIC AND PROOF true or false. “Grass is green” and “2+2 = 5” are propositions . In the ﬁrst part of this chapter, we will study propositional logic , which takes propositions as basic and considers how they can be combined and manipulated . This branch of logic has surprising application to the design of the elec tronic circuits that make up computers. Logic gets more interesting when we consider the internal st ructure of propositions. In English, a proposition is expressed as a sentenc e, and, as you know from studying grammar, sentences have parts. A simple sente nce like “Grass is green” has a subject and apredicate . The sentence says something about its subject. The subject of “Grass is green” is grass. The sen tence says something about grass. The something that the sentence says about its subject is the predicate. In the example, the predicate is the phrase “i s green.” Once we start working with predicates, we can create proposition s usingquantiﬁers like “all,” “some,” and “no.” For example, working with the p redicate “is above average,” we can move from simple propositions like “Johnny is above average” to “All children are above average” or to “No child is above av erage” or to the rather more realistic “Some children are above average.” Lo gical deduction usually deals with quantiﬁed statements, as shown by the basic e xample of human mortality with which we began this chapter. Logical deducti on will be a major topic of this chapter; under the name of proof, it will be the last major topic of this chapter, and a major tool for the rest of this book. 1.1 Propositional Logic A proposition is a statement which is either true or false. In propositional logic, we take propositions as basic and see what we can do with them. Since this is mathematics, we need to be able to talk about propositions without saying which particular propositions we are talking about, so we us e symbolic names to represent them. We will always use lowercase letters such asp,q, andr to represent propositions. A letter used in this way is calle d apropositional variable . Remember that when I say something like “Let pbe a proposition,” I mean “For the rest of this discussion, let the symbol pstand for some particular statement, which is either true or false (although I am not at the moment making any assumption about which it is).” The discussion ha smathematical generality in thatpcan represent any statement, and the discussion will be valid no matter which statement it represents. What we do with propositions is combine them with logical operators . A logical operator can be applied to one or more propositions t o produce a new proposition. Thetruthvalueofthenewpropositioniscompl etelydeterminedby the operator and by the truth values of the propositions to wh ich it is applied.1 1It is not always true that the truth value of a sentence can be determin ed from the truth values of its component parts. For example, if pis a proposition, then “Sarah Palin believes p” is also a proposition, so “Sarah Palin believes” is some kind of operat or. However, it does not count as a logicaloperator because just from knowing whether or not pis true, we get no information at all about whether “Sarah Palin believes p” is true. 1.1. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC 3 In English, logical operators are represented by words such as “and,” “or,” and “not.” For example, the proposition “I wanted to leave and I l eft” is formed from two simpler propositions joined by the word “and.” Addi ng the word “not” to the proposition “I left” gives “I did not leave” (aft er a bit of necessary grammatical adjustment). But English is a little too rich for mathematical logic. When you read the sentence “I wanted to leave and I left,” you probably see a connotation of causality: I left becauseI wanted to leave. This implication does not follow from the logical combination of the truth values of the two propos itions “I wanted to leave” and “I left.” Or consider the proposition “I wanted to leave but I did not leave.” Here, the word “but” has the same logicalmeaning as the word “and,” but the connotation is very diﬀerent. So, in mathematical lo gic, we use symbols to represent logical operators. These symbols do not carry a ny connotation beyond their deﬁned logical meaning. The logical operators corresponding to the English words “and,” “or,”and “not” are ∧,∨, and¬. Deﬁnition 1.1. Letpandqbe propositions. Then p∨q,p∧q, and¬pare propositions, whose truth values are given by the rules: •p∧qis true when both pis true and qis true, and in no other case. •p∨qis true when either pis true, or qis true, or both pandqare true, and in no other case. • ¬pis true when pis false, and in no other case. The operators ∧,∨, and¬are referred to as conjunction ,disjunction , and negation , respectively. (Note that p∧qis read as “ pandq,”p∨qis read as “porq,” and¬pis read as “not p.”) Theseoperatorscanbeusedinmorecomplicatedexpressions ,suchas p∧(¬q) or (p∨q)∧(q∨r). A proposition made up of simpler propositions and logical operators is called a compound proposition . Parentheses can be used in compound expressions to indicate the order in which the oper ators are to be evaluated. In the absence of parentheses, the order of evalu ation is determined byprecedence rules . For the logical operators deﬁned above, the rules are that¬has higher precedence that ∧, and∧has precedence over ∨. This means that in the absence of parentheses, any ¬operators are evaluated ﬁrst, followed by any∧operators, followed by any ∨operators. For example, the expression ¬p∨q∧ris equivalent to the expression ( ¬p)∨ (q∧r), whilep∨q∧q∨risequivalent to p∨(q∧q)∨r. As apractical matter, when you make up your own expressions, it is usually better to put i n parentheses to make your meaning clear. Remember that even if you leave out p arentheses, your expression has an unambiguous meaning. If you say “ ¬p∧q” when what you meant was “ ¬(p∧q),” you’ve got it wrong! This still leaves open the question of which of the ∧operators in the expression p∧q∧ris evaluated ﬁrst. This is settled by the following rule: Whe n several operators of equal precedence occur in the absence o f parentheses, they 4 CHAPTER 1. LOGIC AND PROOF pqrp∧qq∧r(p∧q)∧rp∧(q∧r) falsefalsefalsefalsefalse false false falsefalsetruefalsefalse false false falsetruefalsefalsefalse false false falsetruetruefalsetrue false false truefalsefalsefalsefalse false false truefalsetruefalsefalse false false truetruefalsetruefalse false false truetruetruetruetrue true true Figure 1.1: A truth table that demonstrates the logical equi valence of (p∧q)∧randp∧(q∧r). The fact that the last two columns of this table are identical shows that these two expressions have th e same value for all eight possible combinations of values of p,q, andr. are evaluated from left to right. Thus, the expression p∧q∧ris equivalent to (p∧q)∧rrather than to p∧(q∧r). In this particular case, as a matter of fact, it doesn’t really matter which ∧operator is evaluated ﬁrst, since the two compound propositions ( p∧q)∧randp∧(q∧r) always have the same value, no matter what logical values the component propositions p,q, andrhave. We say that ∧is anassociative operation. We’ll see more about associativity and other properties of operations in the next section. Suppose we want to verify that, in fact, ( p∧q)∧randp∧(q∧r) do always have the same value. To do so, we have to consider all possible combinations of valuesof p,q, andr, andcheckthatforallsuchcombinations, thetwocompound expressions do indeed have the same value. It is convenient t o organize this computation into a truth table. A truth table is a table that shows the value of one or more compound propositions for each possible combi nation of values of the propositional variables that they contain. Figure 1.1is a truth table that compares the value of ( p∧q)∧rto the value of p∧(q∧r) for all possible values ofp,q, andr. There are eight rows in the table because there are exactly e ight diﬀerent ways in which truth values can be assigned to p,q, andr.2In this table, we see that the last two columns, representing the val ues of (p∧q)∧r andp∧(q∧r), are identical. Moregenerally, wesaythattwocompoundpropositionsare logically equivalentif they always have the same value, no matter what truth value s are assigned to the propositional variables that they contain. If the number of propositional variables is small, it is easy to use a truth ta ble to check whether or not two propositions are logically equivalent. 2In general, if there are nvariables, then there are 2ndiﬀerent ways to assign truth values to the variables. This might become clear to you if you try to come up wi th a scheme for systematically listing all possible sets of values. If not, you’ll ﬁnd a r igorous proof of the fact later in this chapter. 1.1. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC 5 There are other logical operators besides ∧,∨, and¬. We will consider theconditional operator ,→, thebiconditional operator ,↔, and the exclusive or operator ,⊕.3These operators can be completely deﬁned by a truth table that shows their values for the four possible co mbinations of truth values of pandq. Deﬁnition 1.2. For any propositions pandq, we deﬁne the propositions p→q, p↔q, andp⊕qaccording to the truth table: pqp→qp↔qp⊕q falsefalsetruetruefalse falsetruetruefalsetrue truefalsefalsefalsetrue truetruetruetruefalse When these operators are used in expressions, in the absence of parentheses to indicate order of evaluation, we use the following preced ence rules: The exclusive or operator, ⊕, has the same precedence as ∨. The conditional operator, →, has lower precedence than ∧,∨,¬, and⊕, and is therefore evaluated after them. Finally, the biconditional operator, ↔, has the lowest precedence and is therefore evaluated last. For example, the expression “ p→q∧r↔ ¬p⊕s” is evaluated as if it were written “( p→(q∧r))↔((¬p)⊕s).” In order to work eﬀectively with the logical operators, you n eed to know more about their meaning and how they relate to ordinary Engl ish expressions. The proposition p→qis called an implication or aconditional . It is usually read as “ pimpliesq.” In English, p→qis often expressed as “if p thenq.” For example, if prepresents the proposition “Bill Gates is poor” and q represents “the moon is made of green cheese,” then p→qcould be expressed in English as “If Bill Gates is poor, then the moon is made of gr een cheese.” In this example, pis false and qis also false. Checking the deﬁnition of p→q, we see that p→qis a true statement. Most people would agree with this. It’s worth looking at a similar example in more detail. Suppose th at I assert that “If the Mets are a great team, then I’m the king of France.” Thi s statement has the form m→kwheremis the proposition “the Mets are a great team” andkis the proposition “I’m the king of France.” Now, demonstrab ly I am not the king of France, so kis false. Since kis false, the only way for m→kto be true is for mto be false as well. (Check the deﬁnition of →in the table!) So, by asserting m→k, I am really asserting that the Mets are nota great team. Or consider the statement, “If the party is on Tuesday, then I ’ll be there.” What am I trying to say if I assert this statement? I am asserti ng thatp→qis true, where prepresents “The party is on Tuesday” and qrepresents “I will be at the party.” Suppose that pis true, that is, the party does in fact take place 3Note that the symbols used in this book for the logical operators ar e not universal. While ∧,∨, and→are fairly standard, ¬is often replaced by ∼and↔is sometimes represented by ≡or⇔. There is even less standardization of the exclusive or operator, but tha t operator is generally not so important as the others. 6 CHAPTER 1. LOGIC AND PROOF on Tuesday. Checking the deﬁnition of →, we see that in the only case where pis true and p→qis true,qis also true. So from the truth of “If the party is on Tuesday, then I will be at the party” and “The party is in fac t on Tuesday,” you can deduce that “I will be at the party” is also true. But su ppose, on the other hand, that the party is actually on Wednesday. Then pis false. When pis false and p→qis true, the deﬁnition of p→qallowsqto be either true or false. So, in this case, you can’t make any deduction about whether or not I will be at the party. The statement “If the party is on Tuesda y, then I’ll be there” doesn’t assert anything about what will happen if the party is on some other day than Tuesday. The implication ( ¬q)→(¬p) is called the contrapositive ofp→q. An implication is logically equivalent to its contrapositive . The contrapositive of “If this is Tuesday, then we are in Belgium” is “If we aren’t in Belgium, then this isn’t Tuesday.” These two sentences assert exactly the same thing. Note that p→qisnotlogically equivalent to q→p. The implication q→p is called the converse ofp→q. The converse of “If this is Tuesday, then we are in Belgium” is “If we are in Belgium, then this is Tuesday. ” Note that it is possible for either one of these statements to be true whil e the other is false. In English, I might express the fact that both statements are true by saying “If this is Tuesday, then we are in Belgium, and conversely .” In logic, this would be expressed with a proposition of the form ( p→q)∧(q→p). The biconditional operator is closely related to the condit ional operator. In fact,p↔qis logically equivalent to ( p→q)∧(q→p). The proposition p↔qis usually read as “ pif and only if q.” (The “ pifq” part represents q→p, while “p only ifq” is another way of asserting that p→q.) It could also be expressed as “ifpthenq, and conversely.” Occasionally in English, “if... then” is used when what is really meant is “if and only if.” For example, if a pare nt tells a child, “If you are good, Santa will bring you toys,” the parent probably really means to say “Santa will bring you toys if and only if you are good.” (Th e parent would probably not respond well to the child’s perfectly logical p lea “But you never said what would happen if I wasn’t good!”) Finally, we turn to the exclusive or operator. The English wo rd “or” is actually somewhat ambiguous. The two operators ⊕and∨express the two possible meanings of this word. The proposition p∨qcan be expressed unambiguously as “porq,or both,” while p⊕qstands for “ porq,but not both .” If a menu says that you can choose soup or salad, it doesn’t mean that yo u can have both. In this case, “or” is an exclusive or. On the other hand, in “Yo u are at risk of heart disease if you smoke or drink,” the or is inclusive sinc e you certainly don’t get oﬀ the hook if you both smoke and drink. In mathematics, th e word “or” is always taken in the inclusive sense of p∨q. Now, any compound proposition that uses any of the operators →,↔, and ⊕can be rewritten as a logically equivalent proposition that uses only ∧,∨, and¬. It is easy to check that p→qis logically equivalent to ( ¬p)∨q. (Just make a truth table for ( ¬p)∨q.) Similarly, p↔qcan be expressed as ((¬p)∨q)∧((¬q)∨p), So, in a strict logical sense, →,↔, and⊕are unnecessary. 1.1. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC 7 (Nevertheless, they are useful and important, and we won’t g ive them up.) Even more is true: In a strict logical sense, we could do witho ut the conjunction operator ∧. It’s easy to check that p∧qis logically equivalent to ¬(¬p∨¬q), so any expression that uses ∧can be rewritten as one that uses only ¬and∨. Alternatively, we could do without ∨and write everything in terms of ¬and∧. Certain types of proposition will play a special role in our f urther work with logic. In particular, we deﬁne tautologies and contradicti ons as follows: Deﬁnition 1.3. A compound proposition is said to be a tautology if and only if it istruefor all possible combinations of truth values of the proposi tional variables which it contains. A compound proposition is said to be acontradiction if and only if it is falsefor all possible combinations of truth values of the propositional variables which it contains. For example, the proposition (( p∨q)∧¬q)→pis a tautology. This can be checked with a truth table: pqp∨q¬q(p∨q)∧¬q((p∨q)∧¬q)→p falsefalsefalsetrue false true falsetruetruefalse false true truefalsetruetrue true true truetruetruefalse false true The fact that all entries in the last column are true tells us t hat this expression is a tautology. Note that for any compound proposition P,Pis a tautology if and only if ¬Pis a contradiction. (Here and in the future, I use uppercase letters to represent compound propositions. Pstands for any formula made up of simple propositions, propositional variables, and logi cal operators.) Logical equivalence can be deﬁned in terms of tautology: Deﬁnition 1.4. Twocompoundpropositions, PandQ, aresaidtobe logically equivalent if and only if the proposition P↔Qis a tautology. The assertion that Pis logically equivalent to Qwill be expressed symbolically as “ P≡Q.” For example, ( p→q)≡(¬p∨q), andp⊕q≡(p∨q)∧¬(p∧q).

(This operator is usually referred to as “ nor,” short for “not or”). Show that each of the propositions ¬p,p∧q,p∨q,p→q,p↔q, andp⊕qcan be rewritten as a logically equivalent proposition that uses ↓as its only operator. 1.2 Boolean Algebra So far we have discussed how to write and interpret propositi ons. This section deals with manipulating them. For this, we need algebra. Ordinary algebra, of the sort taught in high school, is about manipulating number s, variables that represent numbers, and operators such as + and ×that apply to numbers. Now, we need an algebra that applies to logical values, propositi onal variables, and logical operators. The ﬁrst person to think of logic in terms of algebra was the mathematician, George Boole, who introduced the idea in a book that he 1.2. BOOLEAN ALGEBRA 9 published in 1854. The algebra of logic is now called Boolean algebra in his honor. The algebra of numbers includes a large number of rules for ma nipulating expressions. The distributive law, for example, says that x(y+z) =xy+ xz, wherex,y, andzare variables that stand for any numbers or numerical expressions. This law means that whenever you see something of the form xy+xzin a numerical expression, you can substitute x(y+z) without changing the value of the expression, and vice versa . Note that the equals sign in x(y+ z) =xy+xzmeans “has the same value as, no matter what numerical values x,y, andzhave.” In Boolean algebra, we work with logical values instead of nu merical values. There are only two logical values, true and false. We will wri te these values asTandF. The symbols TandFplay a similar role in Boolean algebra to the role that constant numbers such as 1 and 3.14159 play in or dinary algebra. Instead of the equals sign, Boolean algebra uses logical equ ivalence, ≡, which has essentially the same meaning.4For example, for propositions p,q, andr, the≡operator in p∧(q∧r)≡(p∧q)∧rmeans “has the same value as, no matter what logical values p,q, andrhave.” Many of the rules of Boolean algebra are fairly obvious, if yo u think a bit about what they mean. Even those that are not obvious can be ve riﬁed easily by using a truth table. Figure 1.2lists the most important of these laws. You will notice that all these laws, except the ﬁrst, come in pair s: Each law in the pair can be obtained from the other by interchanging ∧with∨andTwithF. This cuts down on the number of facts you have to remember.5 Just as an example, let’s verify the ﬁrst rule in the table, th e Law of Double Negation. This law is just the old, basic grammar rule that tw o negatives make a positive. Although this rule is questionable as it app lies to English as it is actually used—no matter what the grammarian says, “I c an’t get no satisfaction” doesn’t really mean “I can get satisfaction” —the validity of the rule in logic can be veriﬁed just by computing the two possibl e cases: when p is true and when pis false. When pis true, then by the deﬁnition of the ¬ operator, ¬pis false. But then, again by the deﬁnition of ¬, the value of ¬(¬p) is true, which is the same as the value of p. Similarly, in the case where pis false,¬(¬p) is also false. Organized into a truth table, this argument t akes the rather simple form p¬p¬(¬p) truefalsetrue falsetruefalse 4In ordinary algebra, it’s easy to be confused by the equals sign, because i t has two very diﬀerent roles. In an identity such as the distributive law, it means “ is always equal to.” On the other hand, an equation such as x2+ 3x= 4 is a statement that might or might not be true, depending on the value of x. Boolean algebra has two operators, ≡and↔, that play roles similar to the two roles of the equals sign. 5It is also an example of a more general fact known as duality, which asserts that given any tautology that uses only the operators ∧,∨, and¬, another tautology can be obtained from it by interchanging ∧with∨andTwithF. We won’t attempt to prove this here. 10 CHAPTER 1.
