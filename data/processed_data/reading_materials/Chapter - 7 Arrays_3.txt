: Constants, Variables Data Types in C D Arrays The arrays we have discussed sofar are known asonedimensional arrays because the data are organized linearly in only one direction . Many applications require that data bestored inmore than one dimension . One common example isatable, which isanarray that consists ofrows and columns . Chapter : Arrays Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Chapter : Arrays The same reason that necessitated the introduction of1-D array can also beextended to Multi -dimensional Array . For example, tostore the grades of( )students, each of which istaking anumber ofcourses (5say), we would either use -Darrays, one for each student or51-D arrays, one foreach course Multi -Dimensional array allows ustohandle allthese using asingle identifier . -Dimensional array isthe most commonly used multi - dimensional arrays . Other multi -dimensional arrays arealso possible . D Arrays Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Chapter : Arrays Atwo-dimensional array isdeclared inasimilar manner to -Darray but with the addition ofone more bracket asin thefollowing example ; int arr ; Although itisconvenient tothink ofa2-Darray asatable aswill beshown inthe next slide, inreality, arr issimply anarray ofarrays . D Arrays Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Chapter : Arrays D Arrays Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Chapter : Arrays D Arrays Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C D Arrays Initialization Chapter : Arrays Similar to -D array, a two -dimensional array can be created as a list of array initializers, one for each row in the array, as shown by the following: intarr , , , - , , - , , , - , - , , ; OR Intarr
