graphs with the same title. You may wish to elaborate on the title with a brief caption. Do not just repeat the labels for the axes. (c) The scale should be chosen so that it is easy to read, and so that it makes the data occupy more than half of the paper. Good choices of units to place next to major divisions on the paper are multiples of , , and . This makes reading subdivisions easy. Avoid other numbers, especially , , , , since you will likely make errors in plotting and in reading values from the graph. The zero of a scale does not need to appear on the graph. (d) Tick marks should be made next to the lines for major divisions and subdivisions. Logarithmic scales are pre -printed with tick marks. (e) Axis label. The axes should b e labelled with words and with units clearly indicated. The words describe what is plotted, and perhaps its symbol. The units are generally in parentheses. (f) Data should be plotted as precisely as possible, with a sharp pencil and a small dot. In order t o see the dot after it has been plotted, put a circle or box around the dot. If you plot more than one set of data on the same axes use a circle for one, a box for the second, etc., Curve Fitting We are free to make many plots from a given set of data. For instance if we have position (x) as a function of time (t) we can make plots of x versus t, x versus , log(x) versus t, or any number of any choices. If possible,
