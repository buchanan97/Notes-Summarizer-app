Arithmetic Expression : Arithmetic expressions consist of operators, operands, parentheses, and function calls Evaluation of Expressions Allexpressions inparenthesis must beevaluated separately, and inside out. The operator precedence rules for operators insame sub expression :Unary and -areevaluated first and , , evaluated next Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Arithmetic Expression Evaluation Evaluation of Expressions Associtivity rule Unary operators insame sub expressions and atsame precedence level (such as ,-or , )are evaluated right toleft. Binary operators insame sub expressions and atsame precedence level areevaluated lefttoright . Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Precedence Associativity Precedence ofoperators Operator precedence determines which operator isperformed first inanexpression with more than one operators with different precedence . In C,precedence ofarithmetic operators( , , , ,-)ishigher than relational operators( , ! , , , , ) and precedence of relational operator ishigher than logical operators( , and !). For example 30iscalculated as10 ( )and not as( ) .

For Example : ! Here, operators and ! have same precedence .The associativity of both and ! isleft toright, i.e,the expression onthe left isexecuted first and moves towards theright . (( )! ) i.e,( )executes first resulting into (false) then, ( ! ) executes resulting into
