motion we have, from Newton's second law, F - k x m a ( ) The minus sign appears since in this case the acceleration of the object in SHM is in the direction opposite to the force causing it. From this definition , ( ) This motion is periodic, meaning the di splacement, velocity and acceleration all vary sinusoidally. The time required for the body to complete one oscillation is defined as the period, T and is given by , ( ) Notice the period is dependent only upon the mass of the oscillating body and the spring constant, k. As the stiffness of the spring increases (that is, as k increases), the period decreases which has the effect of increasing the body's average velocity. Conversely, an increase in the body's mass means the period will also incr ease, thereby requiring more time for the body to move through one oscillation. It should be noted that the period of motion is independent of the amplitude of the oscillations. Procedure . Arrange a spring AB, a pointer P and a vertical scale as shown in Fig. . . Attach the weights on the hanger gradually and note down the scale reading correspondingly in Table -I. . Plot the graph between extensions (scale readings) versus load for the spring. By taking extension on X-axis load on Y -axis. . The graph of these data is expected to be linear as shown in Fig. . . Deduce the force constant k from the relation k Load Extension . Now determine the period of oscillation T with the help of Digital Stop Clock when different loads are attached on the hanger in Table
