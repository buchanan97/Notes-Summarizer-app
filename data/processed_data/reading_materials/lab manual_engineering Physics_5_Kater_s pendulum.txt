[SOURCE: B.Tech CS Materials] Reversible pendulum (Kater s pendulum) Objective: To determine the value of g at NISER using a reversible pendulum. Apparatus: A reversible pendulum, knife edges, support stands, photodetector stop watch, measuring tape scale. Theory: A physical pendulum is a rigid body swing in a vertical plane about any horizontal axis passing through the body. The resultant force acts through the centre of mass. The time period of oscillation of the physical pendulum is related to the moment of inertia I about the point of suspension. ( ) Where M is the mass of the rigid body and l is the separation between the point of suspension and the centre of gravity. Using the parallel axis theorem the moment of inertia I can be expressed in terms of the moment of inertia about the centre of gravity as ( ) Where k is the radius of gyration and this lead to an expression ( ) The reversible pendulum (Kater s Pendulum) has two pivot points on opposite sides of the centre of gravity from which the pendulum can be suspended (as shown in Fig. ). l A and l Bare the distance of the centre of gravity from pivot points A and B, respectively. Following Eq.( ), the time period about A and B can be written as and If we adjust the length l A and l Bsuch that T A TB T then by simple manipulation we can obtain ( ) Fig. ( ) Here is the equivalent length of the pendulum, which satisfies the condition of reversibility or in other words the period of oscillation around bearing sleeve A and B become equal. Thus, Eq.(
