also valid and both expressions give similar output as . Chapter : Arrays Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C D Array Programs Chapter : Arrays What will be the values at each index of the array? (Answer on the next slide) Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C D Array Programs Chapter : Arrays The Answer is Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Write a program for the Output below (Program on the next slide) Chapter : Arrays Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Chapter : Arrays Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Caution! Caution! Caution! It is the programmer s responsibility to avoid indexing off the end of an array Likely to corrupt data May cause a segmentation fault Could expose system to a security hole! Cdoes NOT check array bounds I.e., whether index points to an element within the array Might be high (beyond the end) or negative (before the array starts) Chapter : Arrays Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Searching and Sorting Chapter : Arrays Searching forelements within an Array (finding the index ofaparticular element) and Sorting the elements ofan Array insome order are two ofthe most primary operations one can perform onan Array . Computer Scientists have done alot ofresearch on Searching and Sorting Algorithms . Besides these two operations other operations that can be performed are:Deleting an element ofthe array and Inserting anew element inthearray Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Searching and Sorting Bubble Sort Insertion Sort Selection Sort Merge Sort Shell Sort And many more sorting algorithms Sorting Algorithms Linear Search Binary Search Searching Algorithms Chapter : Arrays Chapter
