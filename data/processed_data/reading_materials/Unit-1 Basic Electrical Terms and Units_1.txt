Ohm . Limitations of Ohm s Law Ohm s lawisnotapplicable tounilateral networks . Note :-Unilateral networks allow thecurrent toflow inone direction .Such types ofnetwork consist elements like adiode ,transistor, etc. Ohm s law isalso not applicable tonon linear elements . Note :-Non-linear elements arethose which donothave current exactly proportional totheapplied voltage that means theresistance value ofthose elements changes for different values ofvoltage andcurrent .Examples ofnon linear elements arethethyristor . Limitations of Ohm s Law9 Resistors Aresistor isanelectrical component that limits or regulates theflow ofelectrical current inanelectronic circuit . Resistors areone oftheimportant blocks ofelectrical circuits . They aremade upofthemixture ofclay orcarbon, so they arenotonly good conductors butgood insulators . too.

Electrical resistivity (also called specific electrical resistance orvolume resistivity) and itsinverse, electrical conductivity, isafundamental property ofamaterial that quantifies how strongly itresists orconducts electric current . Resistivity iscommonly represented bythe Greek letter (rho) .The SIunit of electrical resistivity istheohm -meter ( m). The resistance ofanobject depends inlarge part onthe material itismade of.Objects made ofelectrical insulators like rubber tend tohave very high resistance and low conductivity, while objects made ofelectrical conductors like metals tend tohave very low resistance andhigh conductivity . The resistance ofanobject also depends onthesize and shape ofanobject because these properties areextensive rather than intensive .Forexample, awire's resistance is higher ifitislong and thin,andlower ifitisshort and thick . Conductor Insulator Semi -Conductor Itisamaterial which has alarge number of free electrons so, the current can easily flow through it. Allmaterials with resistivity less than e- ohm
