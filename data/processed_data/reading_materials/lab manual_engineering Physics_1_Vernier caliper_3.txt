or measure the displacement of the z ero reading from the true zero and correct any measurements accordingly. It is a good idea to check the zero reading throughout the experiment. Physical variations: It is always wise to obtain multiple measurements over the entire range being investigated. Doing so often reveals variations that might otherwise go undetected. These variations may call for closer examination, or they may be combined to find an average value. Parallax: This error can occur whenever there is some distance between the measuring scale and the indicator used to obtain a measurement. If the observer s eye is not squarely aligned with the pointer and scale, the reading may be too high or low (some analog meters have mirrors to help with this alignment). Instrument drift: Most electro nic instruments have readings that drift over time. The amount of drift is generally not a concern, but occasionally this source of error can be significant and should be considered. Lag time and hysteresis: Some measuring devices require time to reach equ ilibrium, and taking a measurement before the instrument is stable will result in a measurement that is generally too low. The most common example is taking temperature readings with a thermometer that has not reached thermal equilibrium with its environme nt. A similar effect is hysteresis where the instrument readings lag behind and appear to have a memory effect, as data are taken sequentially moving up or down through a range of values. Hysteresis is most commonly associated with materials that become magnetized when a changing magnetic field is applied. Personal errors: Come from carelessness, poor technique, or bias on the part of the experimenter. The
