value of the quantity. Random errors on the other hand, can be either positive or negative and lead to a dispersion of the measurements around a mean value. For example, in a time period measurement, errors in starting and stopping the clock will lead to random errors, while a defect in the working of the clock will lead to systematic error. Common sourc es of error in physics laboratory experiments: Incomplete definition: One reason that it is impossible to make exact measurements is that the measurement is not always clearly defined. For example, if two different people measure the length of the same r ope, they would probably get different results because each person may stretch the rope with a different tension. The best way to minimize definition errors is to carefully consider and specify the conditions that could affect the measurement. Failure to a ccount for a factor: The most challenging part of designing an experiment is trying to control or account for all possible factors except the one independent variable that is being analysed . For instance, you may inadvertently ignore air resistance when m easuring free -fall acceleration or you may fail to account for the effect of the Earth s magnetic field when measuring the field of a small magnet . The best way to account for these sources of error is to brainstorm with your peers about all the factors tha t could possibly affect your result. This brainstorm should be done before beginning the experiment so that arrangements can be made to account for the confounding factors before taking data. Sometimes a correction can be applied to a result after taking d ata to
