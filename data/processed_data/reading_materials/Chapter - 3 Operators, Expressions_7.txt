.Short whole number types arelower than longer types .double float long int short char Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Type Conversion Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Conversion Rank Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Type Conversion Continued Type Conversion While Programming consider thefollowing points .An arithmetic operation between aninteger and integer always yields aninteger result . .Anoperation between afloat and float always yields afloat result .Anoperation between aninteger and float always yields a float result .Inthis operation theinteger isfirst promoted toafloat and then theoperation isperformed and thefinal result isafloat . int int int float int float int float float float float float Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Type Conversion Continued .Ifthe expression contains one operand asdouble data type and another operand assome other lower data type then the other operand isalso converted todouble and the result will be double .double operator (float(or)long(or)int(or)short) double .Ifthe expression contains long and unsigned integer data types, the unsigned integer isconverted tounsigned long and theresult will beunsigned long . .Character and short data arepromoted tointeger .Unsigned char and unsigned short are converted to unsigned integer . Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Type Conversion Continued Forced Conversion Forced conversion occurs when weareconverting thevalue ofthelarger data type tothevalue ofthesmaller data type orsmaller data type tothelarger data type . For example, consider thefollowing assignment statement , inta ; float b ; Inthefirst statement a ;aisdeclared asintsothefloat value .5cannot be stored ina.Insuch acase float isdemoted toanintand then itsvalue isstored . hence 5isstored ina. Inthe second
