Second Generation - 1956 -1963: Transistors Transistors replaced vacuum tubes and ushered in the second generation of computers. Transistor is a device composed of semiconductor material that amplifies signal, opens, or closes a circuit. Invented in 7at Bell Labs, transistors have become the key ingredient of all digital circuits, including computers . Today's microprocessors contain tens of millions of microscopic transistors. Prior to the invention of transistors, digital circuits were composed of vacuum tubes, which had many disadvantages . They were much larger, required more energy , dissipated more heat, and were more prone to failures . It is safe to say that without the invention of transistors, computing, as we know it today would not be possibl e. The transistor was invented in 1947 but did not see widespread use in computers until the late 50s. The transistor was far superior to the vacuum tube, allowing computers to become smaller, faster, cheaper, more energy -efficient and more reliable than their first -generation predecessors. Though the transistor still generated a great deal of heat that subjected the computer to damage, it was a vast improvement over the vacuum tube . Second -generation computers moved from cryptic binary machine langua ge to symbolic, or assembly languages, which allowed programmers to specify instructions in wo rds. High -level programming languages were also being developed at this time, such as early versions of COBOL and FORTRAN. Third Generation - 1964 -1971: Integrate d Circuits The development of the integrated circuit was the hallmark of the third generation of computers. Transistors were miniaturized and placed on silicon chips , called
