Structure to a function In C, structure can be passed to functions by two methods . . Passing by value (passing actual value as argument) . Passing by reference (passing address of an argument) C program - Passing Structure Members To Functions include stdio.h int add( int, int) ; struct addition int a, b; int c; sum; void main() printf("Enter the value of a : "); scanf(" d", sum.a); printf(" n Enter the value of b : "); scanf(" d", sum.b); sum.c add(sum.a,sum.b); passing st ructure members as argument to function printf(" n The sum of two value are : "); printf(" d ", sum.c); int add(int x, int
