Department) A -inch Floppy Disk Continue Advantages More suitable than magnetic tapes forawider range ofapplications because they support direct access ofdata. Random access property enables them tobeused simultaneously bymultiple users as ashared device .Atape isnotsuitable forsuch type ofusage duetoitssequential - access property . Suitable forboth in-lineandon-linestorage ofdata. Very large amount ofdata canbestored inasmall storage space . Disadvantages Although used forboth random processing and sequential processing ofdata, for applications ofthelatter type, itmay belessefficient than magnetic tapes . More difficult tomaintain thesecurity ofinformation stored onshared, on-line secondary storage devices,as compared tomagnetic tapes orother types ofmagnetic disks . Optical Disks Consists of a circular disk,which is coated with a thin metal or some other material that is highly reflective. Laser beam technology is used for recording reading of data on the disk Also known as laser disk optical laser disk,due to the laser beam technology. Proved to be a promising random access medium for high capacity secondary storage because it can store extremely large amounts of data in a limited space. Types of Optical Disks Thetypes ofoptical disks inusetoday are: CD-ROM Stands for Compact Disk -Read Only Memory Packaged asshiny, silver color metal disk of5 inch diameter, having astorage capacity ofabout MB Disks come pre-recorded andtheinformation stored onthem cannot bealtered . Pre-recorded bytheir suppliers, byaprocess called mastering . Provide anexcellent medium todistribute large amounts ofdata inelectronic form atlowcost. Asingle CD-ROM disk canhold acomplete encyclopedia, oradictionary etc. Used fordistribution ofelectronic version ofconference proceedings, journals,etc Used bysoftware
