period T Aabout A. . Now turn the pendulum upside down and make sleeve B as the pivot point. Measure the time period T B by varying the position of sleeve B (keeping position of sleeve A fixed) such that is between cm and cm, in steps of cm (just because we already know that this range will work). . Plot the time period T B as a function of . Find the length from the graph corresponding to T T B TA, as recorded in step- . See Fig. for reference.Fig. Fig. . Now to determine the value of T and more accurately, record both T A and T B about sleeves A and B as pivot points, respectively. Again, position of sleeve A remains fixed and position of sleeve B is varied in the range cm with smaller intervals of cm. . Plot T A and T B as a function of on the same scale as shown in Fig. . Find T and at point of intersection of the two curves and calculate g using Eqn.( ). Observations: (I) cm, T A sec (II)Table : Data for T B graph No. of Obs. (cm)TB (sec) .. ..
