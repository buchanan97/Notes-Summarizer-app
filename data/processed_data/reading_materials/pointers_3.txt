Normal variable stores the value whereas pointer variable stores the address of the variable. The content of the C pointer always be a whole number i.e. address. Always C pointer is initialized to null, i.e. int p null. The value of null pointer is . symbol is used to get the address of the variable. symbol is used to get the value of the variable that the pointer is pointing to. If a pointer in C is assigned to NULL, it means it is pointing to nothing. Two pointers can be subtracted to know how many elements are available between these two pointers. But, Pointer addition, multiplication, division are not allowed The size of any pointer is byte (for bit compiler). While declaring initializing the pointer variable, indicates that the variable is a pointer. The address of any variable is given by preceding the variable name with Ampersand . The pointer variable stores the address of a variable. The declaration int a doesn't mean that a is going to contain an integer value. It means that a is going to contain the address of a variable storing integer value. To access the value of a certain address stored by a pointer variable, is used. Here, the can be read as 'value at '. Using a Pointer: Pointers store address of variables or a memory location. To access address of a variable to a pointer, we use the unary operator (ampersand) that returns the address of that variable. For example x gives us address of variable x. include stdio.h int main() int x; Prints address of x printf(" p", x); return ; O P : 0x7ffd5fe51954 C program to demonstrate use
