There are3types ofcurrent that flows intheelectrical circuits . I.Direct Current or DC II.Fluctuating Current III.Alternating Current or AC3 )Direct Current or DC:- The current which always flow inone direction ina circuit iscalled asdirect current . Thus thecurrent whose magnitude remains constant with time and flows continuously inadefinite direction iscalled direct current . )Fluctuating Current :- Ifthecurrent generated bydevices like rectifier, itwill beobserved that the direction ofcurrent remains constant but the magnitude has small periodic variations with time .Such type ofcurrent iscalled fluctuating current . )Alternating Current: - The current which changes its direction and magnitude periodically atregular intervals oftime ina circuit iscalled alternating current . For alternating current orvoltage the only necessary conditions istheperiodic variation with time . Some ofthewave forms areshown as: Advantages of AC over DC .The alternating voltage orcurrents can beincreased or decreased bymeans ofatransformer without any appreciable loss ofenergy whereas direct current is varied byresistance alone resulting loss ofenergy due to heating . .In ACawide range ofvoltage orcurrent isavailable with thehelp oftransformer . .The generation of ACischeaper than that of DC. .Line losses in AC power transmission isnegligible in comparison to DC power transmission for short distance .. .ACcan beeasily converted into DCbyrectifier when so required butconversion of DCinto ACiscostlier . .ACmotors arecheaper and simpler inconstruction . Disadvantages of AC over DC .ACiscomparatively more dangerous touse during faulty insulation asitattracts aperson who touches itunlike
