Two identical coils A and B consisting of 1500 turns each lie in parallel planes such that percent of the flux produced by the current in coil A links the coil B. Current of A flowing in the coil A produces in it a flux of m Wb. Calculate: (i) Self inductance of each coil (ii) Mutual inductance between them If the current in coil A changes from A to - A in
