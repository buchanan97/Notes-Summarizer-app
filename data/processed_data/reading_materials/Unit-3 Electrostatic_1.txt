Q CV Where C Capacitance15 Capacitance of parallel plate capacitor .Aparallel plate capacitor hasplate area 4cm2.Theplates areseparated by three slabs ofdifferent dielectric materials ofthickness , .3mm with relative permittivity , .Calculate combine capacitance and dielectric stress . Solution :- .Aparallel plate capacitor hasplates ofarea 2meter 2spaced bythe three slabs ofdifferent dielectrics .The relative permittivities are ,3and 6and thethickness , .6and .2mm.respectively . Calculate thecombined capacitance and thedielectric stress in each material .When theapplied voltage is1000 V. Solution :- .Acapacitor ismade oftwoplates with anarea of11cm2which are separated bya Mica sheet 2mm thick .Ifrelative permittivity of Mica is6,finditscapacitance .Ifnow oneplate ismoved further to give anairgap0.5mm wide between theplate andmica, find the change incapacitance . Solution :- CAPACITOR IN SERIES In series connection as current is same the change on all capacitors is the same but p.d. across each is different. Substituting the value of V in above equation, we get, Similarly, when n capacitors are connected in series, CAPACITORS IN PARALLEL Thus, Similarly, if there are n capacitors in parallel, then equivalent value of the capacitances is given by, .Calculate charge and voltage of each capacitor. .When twocapacitors Aand Bareconnected across voltd.c.supply, thepotential difference across Ais120 volt andthatacross Bis80volts .The p.d.across Ais rises to140 volts when Bisshunted by3microfarad capacitor .Calculate capacitance of Aand B. microfarad 12240 .Two capacitors having capacitance of6microfarad and microfarad are connected inparallel .A16microfarad capacitor isconnected inseries .With this combination and complete circuit isconnected across V.Calculate :(i)total capacitance ofcircuit (ii)voltage across each capacitor (iii) total charge inthe circuit and (iv) the charge oneach capacitor38 ENERGY STORED IN CAPACITOR When ap.d.isapplied across acapacitor, theelectrons aretransferred from one plate totheother through the source and capacitor ischarged .
