Faults of SMPS Damaged SMPS components Inspect every section carefully to see if there's any broken loose totally detached component. Is the power IC working correctly? --Take out your UC3842 IC Tester unit to measure the power IC. Damaged capacitors is also one the most common SMPS problems so check those as well. Main circuit board problems --Noticed the power supply LED blinking dim shutdown? If yes, then you should measure each component in the main area of SMPS and also do check the secondary area as well. Fan problem Inspect the fan? If the fan doesn't work properly, then excessive heat will occur, resulting in complete shutdown of your ATX SMPS.
