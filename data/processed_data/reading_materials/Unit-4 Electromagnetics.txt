The magnetic field are shown infigure aslines in space . Magnetic Field Direction of Magnetic Field RIGHT HAND THUMB RULE :- Hold theconductor inright hand such that thethumb points the direction ofcurrent flow, then the bent fingers show thedirection ofmagnetic field . When the conductor isplaced perpendicular tothe plane ofthe paper then cross mark shows that the current isflowing intotheplane and dotmark shows that thecurrent iscoming out. Infigure, the current flows into the plane ofpaper and the direction ofthe field is clockwise Infigure, thecurrent comes outoftheplane ofthepaper, the direction ofthe field is anti-clockwise Magnetic Flux The total number of magnetic field lines of force in magnetic field is called magnetic flux. It is denoted by The unit of magnetic flux is Weber (Wb) . Characteristic of magnetic flux lines: - .They have no physical existence. .They form closed paths. .They never intersect each -other. .Lines of magnetic flux closer to each -other and having the same direction repel each -other. .Lines of magnetic flux closer to each -other and having the opposite direction attract each -other. .They exert lateral pressure. Magnetic Flux Density Magneto Motive Force Magneto motive force is defined as the force that tends to establish the flux through a magnetic circuit. It is equal to the product of the current (I) flowing the coil and the number of turns (N) of the coil. Thus, Its unit is ampere -turns or ATbut it is taken as ampere
