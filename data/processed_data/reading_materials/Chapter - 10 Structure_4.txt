declaration statement will never allocate memory Note Chapter : Structures Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Accessing Structure variable Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Looping Sofar, wehave learned how todefine astructure, but didn t talk about how touse it. Inorder touse structures, weshould beable toaccess themembers of thestructure . Two operators areused toaccess members ofstructures : .The structure member operator (.) also called dotoperator . Variable Name .Member Name .The structure pointer operator (- ) also called arrow operator . Pointer Name - Member Name Itispossible define apointer toastructure .- isused toaccess the member ofthestructure variable viapointers . Chapter : Structures Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Accessing Structure variable Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Looping Example :Accessing Structure variable using dot (.)Operator Let s now consider thedate structure (mm dd yyyy ) struct date Defining Structure Type intmonth ; intday; intyear ; ; struct date today ; Members ofthe today structure variables can beaccessed via . operator . Wecan print, read, orassign any value tomembers byaccessing them using .operator . Chapter : Structures Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Accessing Structure variable Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Looping Example Continue today.month ; today.day ; today.year 2004; Below printf statement prints the date in (mm dd yyyy ) format. printf ( d d d , today.month , today.day , today.year ); Chapter : Structures Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Declaration and Initialization of variables Continue Some Important Points Regarding Structure in C Programming : . Struct keyword is used to declare structure. . Members of structure are enclosed within
