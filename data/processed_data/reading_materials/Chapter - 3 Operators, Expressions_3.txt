Postfix Expression : Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Variable Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Classification of Operator Continued Chapter : Operators and Expression in C (a ) has the same effect as (a a )Note Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Classification of Operator Continued Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Result of Postfix a Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Classification of Operator Continued Increment Decrement Operator Symbol Operation Usage postincrement x -- postdecrement x-- preincrement x -- predecrement --x Pre:Increment decrement variable before using itsvalue . Post :Increment decrement variable after using itsvalue . Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Classification of Operator Continued Increment Decrement Operator Example : x ; y x ; Results: x , y (because x is incremented after assignment) x ; y x; Results: x , y (because x is incremented before assignment) Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Classification of Operator Continued Chapter : Operators and Expression in C If is after the operand, as in a , the increment takes place after the expression is evaluated. If is before the operand, as in a, the increment takes place before the expression is evaluated.Note Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Classification of Operator Continued Bitwise Operator Bitwise operator permit programmer to access and manipulate ofdata atbitlevel .
