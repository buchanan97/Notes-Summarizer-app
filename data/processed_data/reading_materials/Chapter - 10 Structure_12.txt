union and other members will contain garbage value. Example : include stdio.h union job char name ; float salary; intworker no ; u; intmain() printf ("Enter name: n"); scanf (" s", u.name ); printf ("Enter salary: n"); scanf (" f", u.salary ); printf ("Displaying n Name : s n",u.name ); printf ("Salary: .1f",u.salary); return ; Output Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Bit Field Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures In addition to bitwise operators, we can declare structures whose members represent bit -fields Bit Field Declaration struct type m ember nam e : width ; ; Below the description of variable elements of a bit field: Elements Description : type An integer type that determines how the bit -field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, unsigned int. member name The name of the bit -field. width The number of bits in the bit -field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type. Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Bit Field Continue Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Example : struct unsigned intwidth Validated : ; unsigned intheight Validated : ; status; The above structure will require 4bytes ofmemory space forstatus variable but only 2bits will beused tostore the values . Ifyou will use upto32variables each one with awidth of1 bit,then also status structure will use 4bytes, but assoon asyou will have 33variables, then itwill allocate next slot ofthememory and itwill start using 8bytes .
