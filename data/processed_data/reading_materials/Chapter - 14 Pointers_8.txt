to Function A function, like a variable, has a type and address location in the memory. It is therefore, possible to declare a pointer to a function We can make a function pointer to point a specific function by simply assigning the name of the of the function to the pointer For example double mul (int, int); double ( p1)(); p1 mul ; To call mul , we may now use the pointer p1 with the list of parameters ( p1)( x,y); Function call is equivalent to Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Compatibility and Casting intx; char p; p (char ) x; Casting When the variable datatype and pointer variable data type is different then casting is necessary Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Compatibility and Casting Void pointer: It is generic pointer All the types can be assigned to void pointer without casting. For example intx; char y; void v; v x; v y; Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Pointers and Structures struct inventory char name ; intnumber; float price; product , ptr ; product: Data object, array of two elements, each of the type strut inventory ptr: pointer to data object of struct inventory ptr product ; assignment Would assign the address of 0thelement of product to ptr. Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Pointers and Structures The pointer ptrwill now point to product . Members can accessed by: ptr- name ptr- number ptr- price Or ( ptr).number Selection Operator for( ptr product; ptr product ; p ) printf ( s d f n ,ptr- name, ptr- number, ptr- price ); Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Troubles with pointers Assigning
