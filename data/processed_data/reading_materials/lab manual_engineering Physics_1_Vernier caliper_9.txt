one Main scale division and N is the number of equal divisions on th e Vernier scale. The total reading M.S.D (V.S.D x L.C). Pitch: Perpendicular distance between two consecutive threads of the screw gauge (linear scale) or spherometer is called PITCH. Pitch of the screw is the distance moved by the spindle per revolut ion. Hence in this case, for one revolution of the screw the spindle moves forward or backward mm. The hollow cylinder leads to a ratchet which is meant for fine adjustment. Least count (L.C .) of micrometer screw gauge: Least count is the minimum dist ance which can be measured accurately by the instrument. The least count of a micrometer screw is the pitch of the screw divided by the number of divisions on the circular scale. Zero Error: It is a defect in a measuring device (Vernier Callipers Screw Gauge).When jaws of a Vernier Callipers or Screw Gauge are closed, zero of main scale must coincide with the zero of Vernier scale or circular scale in case of screw gauge. If they d so not coincide then it is said that a zero error is present in the instru ment. Types of Zero Error: Zero error may be positive or negative. A positive zero error in the instrument shows a larger measurement than the actual measurement. In order to get exact measurement, positive zero error is subtracted from the total readi ng. A negative zero error in the instrument shows a smaller measurement than the actual measurement . In order to get exact measurement, negative zero error is added to the total reading. Procedure .
