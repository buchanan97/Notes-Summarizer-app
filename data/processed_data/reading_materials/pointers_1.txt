y can also be assigned to some other variable. The variables which are used to hold memory addresses are called Pointer variables. A pointer variable is therefore nothing but a variable which holds an address of some other variable. And the value of a pointer variable gets stored in another memory location. Benefits of using pointers . Pointers are more efficient in handling Arrays and Structures. . Pointers allow references to function and thereby helps in passing of function as arguments to other functions. . It reduces length of the program and its execution time as well. . It allows C language to support Dynamic Memory manageme nt. Pointer deceleration : - The general form of a pointer variable declaration is type var -name; Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations int ip; pointer to an integer double dp; pointer to a double float fp; pointer to a float char ch pointer to a character Reference operator ( ) and Dereference operator ( ) is called reference operator. It gives you the address of a variable. Likewise, there is another operator that gets you the value from the address, it is called a dereference operator ( ). Below example clearly demonstrates the use of pointers, reference operator and dereference operator. Note: The sign when declaring a pointer is not a dereference operator. It
