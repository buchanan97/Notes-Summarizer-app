Observations: .Least count of stop watch sec .Distance between K1and CG ( l1) cm .Distance between K2and CG ( l2) cm .Table for time period T1(oscillation about K1): Sr. No. Number of oscillations Time of Oscillations t1 sec Time period T1 t1 n Mean T (sec) .Table for time period T2 (Oscillations about K2) : Sr. No. Number of oscillations Time of Oscillations t2 sec Time period T2 t2 n Mean T (sec) Calculations: Using equation and depending on the value of T1and T2 calculate the value of g. Result: Acceleration due to gravity g m s2 Standard value of g m s2 Percentage Error: Precautions: . The two knife -edges should be parallel to each other. . The amplitude of vibration should be small so that the motion of the pendulum satisfies the condition of simple harmonic motion. . To avoid any irregularity of motion the time period should be noted after the pendulum has made a few oscillations. . To avoid friction there should be glass surface on rigid support.
