The voltage between anytwolines is called linevoltage . They arerepresented by , and respectively . Similarly currents flowing intheeach winding isknown asthephase current and current flowing ineach line is called thelinecurrent . Since the system is balanced, Relation between line current and phase current: Relation between linevoltage andphase voltage : Itisseen from figure that instar connection, there aretwo phase windings between each pairoflineterminals . Since similar ends ofthese twowinding areconnected together, the emfs across them oppose each other andtheir instantaneous values willhave opposite polarities . Therefore thermsvalue oflinevoltage between anytwolines willbe obtained bythevector difference ofthetwophase voltages . Thephasor diagram ofthephase emfs andcurrents inastarconnected system isshown below : Line voltage between terminals Rand Y, Hence itisclear thatinastarconnected system, thelinevoltage isobtained asthe vector difference ofthetwocorresponding phase voltages . This isshown infigbelow, forexamples isfound byadding and reversed anditsmagnitude isgiven bythediagonal oftheparallelogram . Since side oftheparallelogram areofequal length and angle between twophase voltages is60degree . Thelinevoltage isgiven by, Theemfacross each winding iscalled phase voltage . They aredenoted by , and . The voltage between anytwolines is called linevoltage . They arerepresented by , and respectively . Similarly currents flowing intheeach winding isknown asthephase current and current flowing ineach line is called thelinecurrent . Since the system is balanced, Relation between line voltage and phase voltage: Relation between linecurrent andphase current : Itisseen from figure thatcurrent flowing ineach lineisthevector difference ofthetwophase currents .
