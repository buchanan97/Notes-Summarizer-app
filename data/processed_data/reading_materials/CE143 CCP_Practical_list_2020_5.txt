DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER ENGINEERING ACADEMIC YEAR: 2020 - and Programming and computes the number of students in categories FAIL, PASS, FIRST CLASS and DISTINCTION using Pointers and Arrays. Marks Categories or Above DISTINCTION to FIRST CLASS to PASS Below FAIL For example, if following marks of students are entered: Then the output should be DISTINCTION FIRST CLASS PASS FAIL Write a program that uses an array of pointers to strings str . Receive two strings str1 and str2 and check if str1 is embedded in any of the strings in str . If str1 is found, then replace it with str2. char str "We will teach you how to ", "Move a mountain", "Level a building", "Erase the past", "Make a million", " all through C!" ; For example if str1 contains "mountain" and str2 contains "car", then the second string in str should get changed to "M ove a car". (Array of Pointers) Write output for the following programs: .
