write as (name i j) The character arrays with the rows of varying length called Ragged Arrays Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Array of Pointers Difference between p and ( p) Since has a lower precedence than , p declares p as an array of pointers ( p) declares p as a pointer to an array of elements Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Pointers as Function Arguments The address should pass to the function as an argument The parameters receiving the address should be pointers The process of calling a function using pointers to pass the address of variables is known as call by reference. The process of passing actual value of variables is known as call by value. Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions intswap( int ,int ); void main() intx,y; x ; y ; printf ("Before Exchange: x d y d n n",x,y); swap ( x, y ); printf ("After Exchange: x d y d n n",x,y); getch (); intswap (int a,int b) intt; t a; a b; b t; Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Pointers as Function Arguments Note: The function parameters are declared as pointers The dereferenced pointers are use in the function body When the function is called, the addresses are passed as actual arguments Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Function Returning Pointers Function can return multiple values through pointer parameters Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions large(); void main() intx ,y , p; clrscr (); p large( x, y ); printf (" d", p); getch (); large( int a,int b) if( a b) return(a); else return(b); Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Pointer
