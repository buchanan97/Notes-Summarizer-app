calipe r for errors like play in the jaw, zero error if any. . If any error is present, correct it. . Calculate the least count of the instrument. . Hold the workpiece in the measuring jaws. . Note down the readings of main scale and Vernier scale micro meter screw. . Complete the observation table. . All the calculations are required to be done in accordance with error analysis. Precaution . Make sure that the Vernier calipers micrometer screw gu age is rest free smooth with all the division markings observable. . Ensure that the zero error is worked out properly before actual measurement. . The object must be held tightly between the jaws. . All measurements must be done without parallax error. . Do not a pply undue pressure.
