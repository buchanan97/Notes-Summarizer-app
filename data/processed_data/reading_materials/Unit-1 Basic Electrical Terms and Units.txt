Itismeasured asthenetrate offlow ofelectric charge past aregion . The SIunit ofelectric current istheampere ,or amp, which istheflow ofelectric charge across a surface attherate ofone coulomb persecond . Current canbemeasured using anammeter . Current For asteady flow ofcharge through asurface, the current I(in amperes) can becalculated with the following equation : where Qisthe electric charge transferred through the surface over atime t.If Qand tare measured in coulombs and seconds respectively, Iisinamperes . More generally, electric current can berepresented as therate atwhich charge flows through agiven surface as: Current Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure orelectric tension isthe difference in electric potential between two points, which (ina static electric field) isdefined asthe work needed perunit ofcharge tomove atest charge between the two points . In SIunits, work per unit charge isexpressed as joules percoulomb, where 1volt 1joule (ofwork) per1coulomb (ofcharge ). Voltage orelectric potential difference isdenoted symbolically by V, V, or U Avoltmeter can beused tomeasure thevoltage (or potential difference) between two points inasystem . Voltage In electronics and electromagnetism, the electrical resistance ofanobject isameasure of itsopposition totheflow ofelectric current . Resistance Ohm s Law Ohm s law states that thecurrent through any conductor isdirectly proportional tovoltage orpotential difference between itsends, ifthe physical conditions oftheconductor donotchange . or Orwecanstate itas, . This relationship between current, voltage was discovered by German scientist Georg Simon
