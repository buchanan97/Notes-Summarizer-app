[SOURCE: B.Tech CS Materials] C functions can be classified into two categories, . Library functions . User -defined functions Library functions are those functions which are already defined in C library, example printf() , scanf() , strcat() etc. You just need to include appropriate header files to use these functions. These are already declared and defined in C libraries. A User -defined functions on the other hand, are those functions which are defined by the user at the time of writing program. These functions are made for code reu sability and for saving time and space. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. C allows you to define functions according to your need. These functions are known as user -defined functions There are many situations where we might need to write same line of code for more than once in a program. This may lead to unnecessary repetition of code, bugs and even becomes boring for the programmer. So, C language provides an approach in which you can declare and define a group of statements once in the form of a function and it can be called and used whenever required. These functions defined by the user are also know as User - defined Functions Benefits of Using Functions . It provides modularity to your program's structure. . It makes your code reusable. You just have to call the function by its name to use it, wherever required. . In case of large programs with thousands of code lines, debugging and editing becomes easier if you use functions. . It makes the program more readable and easy to understand. Components Element of user defined function
