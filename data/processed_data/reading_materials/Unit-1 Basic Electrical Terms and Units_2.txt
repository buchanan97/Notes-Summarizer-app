.mbehave as conductor . E.g. Silver, Copper, Aluminium, Carbon and almost allmatels . Ifthe outer electrons ofamaterial arevery tightly bound tothe nucleus, itbecomes very difficult to remove from their orbits .Hence current cannot flow through such materials and they are know as insulators . All materials with resistivity above e5ohm .mbehave asconductor . E.g.Mica, Porcelain, Glass, oil,rubber, etc. Itismaterial in which outer electrons arebound tothe nucleus but theelectrons can be made free bysome means . For examples byadding some impurity . All material with resistivity between 10e- and 10e5 ohm .mbehave as semi -conductor . E.g. Germanium and Silicon . Resistance ofalmost allthematerials changes with the change inthetemperature . Resistance of the material at degree Celsius Resistance ofthematerial attdegree Celsius Then thechange inresistance isfound tobe I.directly proportional to its initial resistance, and II.directly proportional to the change in temperature . Thus, constant know asthe temperature co-efficient of resistance . R Rt R R Rt R R t () R R R tt () R R R tt Temperature co-efficient of resistance Continue . The variation ofresistance with change intemperature ofany material isgoverned bythis property . Temperature co-efficient ofresistance isdefined as thechange inresistance per unit rise intemperature perohm original resistance . Usually temperature co-efficient istaken ataparticular reference temperature which isnormally taken as0 degree Celsius . Itisdenoted by Rewriting theequation ( ), Resistance at different temperatures17 Ifatastandard temperature ofodegree Celsius a material hasaresistance of R0ohms, att1degree Celsius resistance of R1ohms and att2degree Celsius resistance of R2ohms, then Continue . Continue . Effect of temperature on Resistance Metals Alloys Insulators, Semi - Conductors Electrolytes Resistance ofpure metals increases with the rise in temperature . The increase in resistance islarge andregular . Metals have
