: member m; ; struct is the required C keyword tagis the name of the structure member , member , are individual member declarations Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Structure definition Continue The individual members can be ordinary variables, pointers, arrays, orother structures (any data type) The member names within aparticular structure must be distinct from one another Amember name can bethesame asthename ofavariable defined outside ofthestructure Once astructure has been defined, the individual structure -type variables can bedeclared as: struct tagvar ,var , ,var n ; Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Structure definition Continue ACompact Form Syntax : Itispossible tocombine the declaration ofthe structure with that ofthestructure variables : struct tag member ; member ; : member m; var ,var , ,var n ; Declares three variables oftype struct tag Inthis form, tagisoptional Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Structure definition Continue Various Structure declaration form : Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Omitting thetag field ; cannot create any more variables with the same type as z Declares x to be a structure having two members, a and b. In addition, the structure tag S is created for use in future declarations Omitting the variable list defines the tag S for use in later declarations Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Structure definition Continue Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Omitting the member list declares another structure variable y with the same type as xomitting . Incomplete declaration which informs the compiler that Sisa structure tag to be defined later
