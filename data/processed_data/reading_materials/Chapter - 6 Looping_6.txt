that theuser isdone entering values . The sentinel, ofcourse, must bedistinct from any value the user may want toinput . Chapter : Looping Nesting of looping statements Aloop inside another loop iscalled anested loop . The depth ofnested loop depends onthe complexity ofa problem . Wecan have any number ofnested loops asrequired . Consider anested loop where the outer loop runs ntimes and consists ofanother loop inside it. The inner loop runs mtimes . Then, the total number oftimes the inner loop runs during theprogram execution isn m . Chapter : Looping Nesting of looping statements Types of nested loops : . Nested while loop . Nested do -while loop . Nested for loop Chapter : Looping Nesting of looping statements . Nested while loop : A while loop inside another while loop is called nested while loop. Syntax : while (condition1) statement(s); while (condition2) statement(s); Chapter : Looping Nesting of looping statements . Nested while loop : Example of Nested while loop : C program to print the number pattern. Output : Chapter : Looping Nesting of looping statements Inthis program, nested while loop isused toprint thepattern . The outermost loop runs 5times and for every loop, the innermost loop runs itimes which is1atfirst, meaning only " " isprinted, then onthe next loop it's2numbers printing " " and soontill5iterations ofthe loop executes, printing "1234 ". This way, thegiven number pattern isprinted . Chapter : Looping Nesting of looping statements . Nested do -while loop : A do -while loop inside another do -while loop is called nested do -while loop. Syntax : do statement(s); do statement(s); while (condition2); while (condition1); Chapter : Looping Nesting of looping statements .Nested do-while
