oftheemf. The duration ofeach cycle is called periodic time or time period . Average value or mean value The steady current (d.c.)which flows through acircuit foragiven time transfer same charge astransferred by thealternating current when flows through thesame circuit forsame time iscalled average value ofthe alternating current . Theaverage ormean value ofana.c.quantity over agiven interval isthesum ofallinstantaneous values divided bynumber ofvalues taken over thatinterval . Analytical Method :- This method isbased onthedefinition oftheaverage value ofthe alternating current . Theaverage value canbeobtained as: Average value of sinusoidal alternating current Since it is a symmetrical wave, we can consider only half -cycle. Average value of half -wave rectified current Since it is a unsymmetrical, we can consider full -cycle. RMS value The steady current (d.c.)which flows through acircuit foragiven time produces same amount ofheat as produced by the alternating current when flows through the same circuit forthe same time iscalled r.m.s.value ofthealternating current . R.M.S. value of sinusoidal alternating current31 RMS value of half -wave rectified current Since itisaunsymmetrical, wecanconsider full-cycle . Form Factor Itisdefined astheratio ofr.m.svalue ofanalternating quantity . Mathematically, Incase ofsinusoidal alternating current, Peak Factor Itisdefined asthe ratio ofmaximum value tor.m.s value ofthealternating quantity .
