- II. Let m be the mass of the load. Using this relation, compute k for the different m versus T data. Check if k comes out constant, and check if its value agrees with that obtained from equation ( ). For low m values, there may be a serious departure. . In case the spring deviates from Hooke s laws but is elastic the k deduced in step should match the corresponding k deduced in step , assuming small amplitude oscillations are used to get T. Precaution . Do not stretch the spring by hand. . It is advisable to stretch a wire on the scale (parallel to its markings) and to let the pointer and move between this wire and the markings. . Apply only small oscillations . . If experiment is over, remove the extra load from the hanger . Observations Gravitational acceleration of earth (any other planet) (g) Observation Table Sr. No. Load (m) (in gm) Extension (x) (in cm) Spring constant (k) Increasing Load (XI) Decreasing Load (XD) Xmean (cm) n Graph Fig Graph of load versus extension Calculation s Results Spring Constant (k) N m Review questions . Write Hooke s law ? . Write the equation for acceleration using the relation between Hooke s law and Newton s second law of motion. . If k increases, that means the stiffness of the spring .
