Thelarger thespring constant thestiffer thespring . Youmay beable toseethisbylooking atthegraphs below : k is measured in units of newtons per metre (Nm- ). Hooke s Law Example A spring is .38m long. When it is pulled by a force of N, it stretches to m. What is the spring constant? (Assume the spring behaves elastically.) Extension, x Stretched length Original length .42m .38m m F K x N K m K N m Hooke s Law Key Definitions Hooke s Law The amount a spring stretches isproportional totheamount offorce applied to it. The spring constant measures how stiff the spring is.The larger thespring constant the stiffer thespring . ADiagram toshow Hooke s Law Experiment : Hooke s Law .Arrange aspring AB,apointer Pandavertical scale asshown in Fig. . .Attach theweights onthehanger gradually andnote down thescale reading correspondingly in Table -I. .Plotthegraph between extension (scale readings) versus load forthespring .Bytaking extension on X-axis load on Y-axis. . The graph of these data is expected to be linear as shown in Fig. . . Deduce the force constant kfrom the relation k Load Extension . Now determine the period of oscillation T with the help of Digital Stop Clock when different loads are attached on the hanger in Table -II. Let mbe the mass of the load. Using this relation, compute kfor the different m versus T data. Check if kcomes out constant, and check if its value agrees with that obtained from equation ( ). For low mvalues, there may be a serious departure. . In case the spring deviates from hook's laws but is elastic the k deduced in step should match the corresponding kdeduced in step , assuming small amplitude
