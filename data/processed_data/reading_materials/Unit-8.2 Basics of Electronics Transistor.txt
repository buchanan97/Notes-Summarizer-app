[SOURCE: B.Tech CS Materials] Basics of Electronics Transistor: Terminology, Working, Configuration, Applications, Examples Prepared by: Ankur Patel M V Patel Department of Electrical Engineering ankurpatel.ee charusat.ac.in Introduction Transistor Terminology Working of Transistor Current from a low resistance circuit to a high resistance circuit. Transistor Symbols Transistor Connection Example: In a common base connection, . The voltage drop across k resistance which is connected in the collector is V. Find the base current . Solution: IC V k m A IC IE Characteristics of common base connection Common Emitter connection Common Emitter Characteristics Common collector connection Commonly used transistor connection Modulation :-The process ofchanging some characteristic (e.g. amplitude, frequency orphase) ofacarrier wave inaccordance with theintensity ofthesignal isknown asmodulation . Example :For common base circuit shown in Figure .Determine ICand VCB .Assume transistor tobeofsilicon .
