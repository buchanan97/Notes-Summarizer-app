program development cycle, the flowchart plays the role of a blueprint, w hich makes program development process easier. After successful development of a program, it needs cont inuous timely maintenance during the course of its operation. The flowchart makes program or system maintenance easier. It is easy to convert the flowchart int o any programming language code. Algorithm Flowchart Manual CIC-UHF Flowchart is diagrammatic Graphical representation of sequence of steps to solve a problem. To draw a flowchart following standard symbols are use Symbol Name Symbol function Oval Used to represent start and end of flowchart Parallelogram Used for input and output operation Rectangle Processing: Used for arithmetic operations and data-manipulations Diamond Decision making . Used to represent the operation in which there are two three alternatives, true and false etc Arrows Flow line Used to indicate the flow of logic by connecting symbols Circle Page Connector Off Page Connector Predefined Process Function Used to represent a group of statements performing one processing task. Preprocessor -------------- --------- -------------- Comments Algorithm Flowchart Manual CIC-UHF The language used to write algorithm is simple and similar to day -to-day life language. The variable names are used to store the values . The value store in variable can change in the solution steps. In addition some special symbols are used as below Assignment Symbol ( or ) is used to assign value to the variable. e.g. to assign value to the variable HEIGHT, statement is HEIGHT or HEIGHT The symbol is used in most of the programming language as an assignment symbol, the same has been used in all the algorithms and flowchart s in the manual. The statement C A B means that
