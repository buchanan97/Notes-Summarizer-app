[SOURCE: B.Tech CS Materials] Experiment AIM DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC HEAT TWO DIFFERENT METALS. COMPARE YOUR RESULTS WITH THE ACCEPTED VALUES OF THESE METALS. Apparatus Metal sample, hot plate, weight machine, thermometer, beaker, thread. Pictorial Diagram Pictorial Diagram of newton s cooling law Theory Heat is needed to warm up anything, but the amount of heat is not the same for all things. Therefore, it is desirable to know the specific heat of a substance. The specific heat capacity of a material is defined as the heat required to raise a unit mass ( gram) of the substance by a fixed temperature ( o C). This is sometimes also called the specific heat of a material, and is often abbreviated Cp (which stands for heat Capacity at a constant pressure). As we have already covered in class, the heat capacity of water is exactly cal (g o C). It takes calorie, to raise the temperature of gram of water o C. This is how the calorie is defined. If needed, you can convert calories to Joules with the conversion factor cal Joules The specific heat capacity of water is a constant value, but other materials (like metals) have their own constant heat capacity. In this lab, you will be measuring and comparing the heat capacity of two metals. Work in groups of two to complete this activity. The formula for heat change in a material is q m T Cp (In words, this means: heat absorbed (q) mass (m) temperature change ( T) specific heat ( Cp) all four variables must refer to the same material - for example, the heat absorbed by a sample of water equals the mass of
