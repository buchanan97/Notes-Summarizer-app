) eliminates the need to locate the center of gravity or the radius of gyration of the rigid body, which is a major of error inherent to the simple pendulum and bar pendulum. The Setup The experimental set-up is illustrated in Fig. . The knife edges must be fixed at the same height so as to make sure the mass of the pendulum will be distributed evenly over both bearing points. Make sure that the table and the stage supporting the knife edges do not move with the pendulum. The geometrical length of the rod used as reversible pendulum is cm to which the bearing sleeves (referred as A and B) can be screwed at a desired position. The time period T of the pendulum is determined for small oscillating amplitudes with the fork light barrier. The light barrier is operated in the period measurement mode (switch shifted to the right side) and situated at the point of maximum amplitude of the pendulum. The time elapsed between two consecutive phases is measured, when the pendulum just leaves the infrared beam. This lapse of time is the period T at the point of maximum amplitude, as long as the pendulum keeps covering the beam while it reverses its trajectory. Procedure: In this experiment in order to find g, first we need to determine the equivalent length . . Throughout the experiment sleeve A is fixed at a distance of cm from one end of the pendulum. Position of sleeve B can be varied. . Adjust the bearing sleeve B so that the distance between the two sleeves, is roughly 45cm. Make sleeve A as the pivot point and record the time
