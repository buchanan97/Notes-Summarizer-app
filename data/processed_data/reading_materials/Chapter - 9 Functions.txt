[SOURCE: B.Tech CS Materials] Devang Patel Institute of Advance Technology and Research CE143: COMPUTER CONCEPTS PROGRAMMING Chapter User -Defined Functions Objectives Tobeable tooutline user -defined functions To be able toidentify the elements ofuser -defined functions Tobeable toexplain thedifferent categories offunctions Tobeable toknow theconcept ofrecursion Tobeable todescribe how arrays arepassed tofunctions Tobeable todiscuss the relevance ofstorage classes on scope, visibility and lifetime ofvariable . Chapter : User -Defined Functions Introduction In this chapter, we will discuss How a function is designed? How a function is integrated into a program? How two or more functions are put together? How they communicate with one another? Chapter : User -Defined Functions Introduction Functions Library Functions User - Defined Functions Ex: printf , scanf Ex: main Chapter : User -Defined Functions Need for User -Defined Functions main isspecially recognized function, which isused to indicate start ofprogram execution . Byusing only main following problems may occur : Programs becomes toolarge Higher complexity Debugging, testing and maintaining becomes difficult Ifprogram isdivided into functional parts, then each part can beindependently coded and combined into single unit Chapter : User -Defined Functions Need for User -Defined Functions Independently coded programs arecalled Subprograms . They areeasy tounderstand, debug and test. Subprograms arereferred as functions in C. There are times when certain operations and calculations arerepeated inprogram . For Example :Factorial ofanumber For such requirements afunction can bedesigned and used whenever required . Chapter : User -Defined Functions Top -down Modular programming Main Program Function AFunction BFunction C Chapter : User -Defined Functions Modular programming Characteristics .Each module should doonly one thing . .Communication between modules isallowed only byacalling module . .Amodule can becalled byone and only one higher module .
