[SOURCE: B.Tech CS Materials] Structure is a collection of variables of different types under a single name. Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds. Defining a Structure To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows : struct structure tag member definition or Data type member ; member definition or Data type member ; member definition or Data type member n ; one or more structure variables ; struct person char name ; int cit No; float salary; P; Structure variable declaration Three Different ways to the declare structure variable : Example : struct person char name ; int cit No; float salary; P1,P2; Example : struct person char name ; int cit No; float salary; Struct person P ,P2; Example : struct person char name ; int cit No; float salary; ; void main() Struct person P; Structure variable char name ; int cit No; float salary; ; Structure variable char name ; int cit No; float salary; ; Structure variable char name ; int cit No; float salary; ; Structure member char name ; int cit No; float salary; ; Structure member char name ; int cit No; float salary; ; Structure member char name ; int cit No; float salary; ; Structure name char name ; int cit No; float salary; ; Structure name char name ; int cit No; float salary; ; Structure
