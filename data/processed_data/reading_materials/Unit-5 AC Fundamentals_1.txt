DCwhich gives arepelling shock . .For certain purpose such as electric traction, electronic circuits, electroplating, electro -refining, computers etc ,where only dcisrequired, accan notbeused directly . Comparison of AC with DC Alternating Current Direct Current .In AC voltage and current reverses periodically . .In DC voltage and current remains constant . .Low cost ofpower generation . .Higher cost ofpower generation . .Cost oftransmitting ACpower can be reduced byusing step -uptransformers . .Nosuch provision canbemade . .ACcan beconverted into DCbyusing a device, called converter (rectifier) . .DC can beconverted to AC byusing inverter . .AC cannot be used directly for electroplating, electrotyping, etc .DCcan beused directly forcarrying out such operations . .AC motors and other appliances are more robust, and durable . .DC motors, and appliances are less durable . .AC attracts aperson, so faulty insulations of ACaremore dangerous . .DCgives arepelling shock toaperson, so faulty insulations of DCareless dangerous . Definitions .Waveform : The shape ofthe curve obtained byplotting the instantaneous values ofalternating quantity along yaxis and time orangle along x-axis iscalled waveform . .Instantaneous Value: - The value ofanalternating quantity (voltage current and power etc )atany instant iscalled its instantaneous value . Itisrepresented bysmall English letters i.e.v,i,p,e respectively . .Cycle: - One complete setofpositive and negative values ofan alternating quantity isknown ascycle . .Amplitude :- The maximum value (positive ornegative) ofan alternating quantity isknown asitsamplitude . .Time Period :- The time taken byanalternating quantity tocomplete one cycle iscalled itstime period . Itisdenoted by T. Itisexpressed inseconds . The relationship b w frequency and periodic time(T) isgiven by: .Frequency :- The number ofcycles completed byanalternating quantity persecond isknown asfrequency . Itisdenoted byf Itisexpressed inhertz (Hz) orcycle second . The frequency
