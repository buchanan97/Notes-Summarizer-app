around the metal cube in the plastic cup with the thermometer, until the thermometer reading becomes stable. You can treat this measurement as the final temperature of both the water and the final temperature of the metal block. . Calculate t he change in temperature of the water in the plastic cup. Show your work. Label this T (H2 O) . Calculate the heat absorbed by the water in the foam cup. Use the equation q m T Cp . All variables must apply to the water in the cup. Label the solution to this equation q (water) . Based on the heat absorbed by the water, how much heat was emitted by the metal cube? Label this value q (metal) . Calculate the change in temperature of the metal block label this T (metal) . Now solve for the specific heat of th e metal. Again use the equation, q m T Cp but this time make sure all the variables apply to the metal. You took the mass of the metal, calculated the change in temperature of the metal, and calculate the heat absorbed by the metal. The only unknown to solve for is Cp, the specific heat of the metal. . Choose a second metal cube, and repeat the lab. If you finish early, try a third. Precaution . Wear your safety goggles. . Wash your hands after handling the metals. . There is no waste for this experiment. Return the metal samples so that they can be re -used. Observations The Specific heat of water is cwater , J (kg C). Mass of the calorimeter cup: kg Mass of the calorimeter cup plus water: kg Observati
