(A) since N is dimensionless. The work done in carrying a unit magnetic pole ( Wb) once through the entire magnetic circuit is called magneto motive force. MAGNETIC FIELD INTENSITY Magnetic field intensity is defined as a the magnetomotive force per unit length of the magnetic flux path. It is denoted by H. Its unit is AT m H mmf L NI L Reluctance PERMEANCE RELUCTIVITY Classification of magnetic material Magnetic materials are classified according to their relative permeability Ferromagnetic materials Their relative permeability is greater than unity and dependent on field strength. They are easily magnetized. Ex: Iron, Cobalt, Nickel Paramagnetic material Relative permeability is slightly greater than unity and They are slightly magnetized. Ex: Aluminium, Platinum Diamagnetic material Relative permeability is slightly less than unity and have the opposite effect of paramagnetic materials. Ex: Silver, copper, hydrogen Electricity and Magnetism The shape of the magnetic field around a long, straight wire carrying electric current Looping the wire turns the magnetic field into a toroidal (donut) shape.Many loops in a solenoid shape creates a dipole - shaped magnetic field, similar to that of a bar magnet Right hand rule If straight wire is grasped with the right hand, with the thumb pointing in the direction of current , fingers will purl in direction of magnetic field. When the conductor is placed perpendicular to the plan of paper then Shows that the current is flowing into the plane and Shows that the current is coming out. Electromagnetic induction Faraday s 1st Laws of Electromagnetic Induction Faraday s law : Relative motion of a wire and a magnetic field will induce an e.m.f. (voltage). If there is a complete circuit ,
