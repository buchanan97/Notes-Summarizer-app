Linear power Supply Design Switch Mode power supply Design Phases of SMPS . Input rectifier stage :Itisused toconvert anacinput todc.ASMPS with dcinput does notrequire thisstage .The rectifier produces unregulated dc which isthen passed through thefilter circuit . .Inverter stage : The inverter stage converts DC, whether directly from the input orfrom therectifier stage described above, to AC byrunning it through apower oscillator, . .Output transformer :-Iftheoutput required istobeisolated from input then itconverts thevoltage upordown totherequired output level onit s secondary winding . .Output rectifier :-Ifthedcoutput isrequired, theacoutput from the transformer isrectified . .Regulation :-Feedback circuit monitors theoutput voltage andcompares it with thereference voltage . SMPS ? SMPS means Switch Mode Power Supply. This is used for A.C to D.C conversion. This works on the principle of switching regulation. The SMPS system is highly reliable, efficient, noiseless and compact because the switching is done at very high rate in the order of several KHz to MHz Ittransfers power from asource, toaload, while converting voltage and current characteristics . Voltage regulation isachieved byvarying theratio ofon-to-offtime. Advantages of SMPS over Linear Power Supplies: Lower weight Smaller size Higher efficiency Lower power dissipation Wide ac input voltage range Reduced costs Disadvantages of SMPS : Complexity ofthecircuit Output Connector SMPS (Switching Mode Power Supply) hasdifferent connector formotherboard, disk drives
