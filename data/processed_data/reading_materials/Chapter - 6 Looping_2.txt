powerful and flexible looping structure . Wecan perform any complex task using forloop . Chapter : Looping Entry Controlled Loop -for loop for ( initialization ; condition ; inc dec) loop body Syntax Chapter : Looping Entry Controlled Loop -for loop For loop contains three different parts :initialization, condition and inc dec part . When the loop executes for the first time, initialization ofthe counter variable will bedone after that expression given into the condition part istested, iftest expression evaluate totrue, control will enter into theloop body . The statements inside theloop will beexecuted . After that control will transfer tothe third part where counter value will beeither incremented ordecremented . With themodified counter value test expression will becheck again toenter into theloop . Chapter : Looping Entry Controlled Loop -for loop This process will berepeated until condition becomes false . Once the condition becomes false, the loop will beskipped and statement following byforloop will beexecuted . The initialization will beperformed only once when loop encounters first time . For loop also allows specify multiple condition aswell ascomplex expression tobetested . Wecan also skip any ofthepart oftheloop asper our requirement . forloop can also beexecuted either instraight forward orinreverse manner similar towhile loop .
