we have to execute some statements repeatedly as long as certain condition become true we can use the while loop. In the while loop ,the given expression will be check at the time of the loop entry, if given expression becomes true then control will transfer into the loop body. The statement inside the loop body will be executed. The counter value will be modified and again given expression will be checked to enter in to the loop. This process will continue until the given expression become false. The while loop contains only expression part ,initialization will be done before the while loop Chapter : Looping Entry Controlled Loop -while loop while(condition) loop body Syntax while( i ) printf(" n Value of I is d", i) ; i ; modify counter value Example Chapter : Looping program to print multiplication table using while loop. void main() int n, i, ans; clrscr(); printf(" n Enter No. to print Table : "); scanf(" d", n); i ; set counter value to while( i ) ans n i; printf(" n d d d", n,i, ans) ; i ; modify counter value getch(); Entry Controlled Loop -while loop Chapter : Looping Entry Controlled Loop -while loop The While Statement : Example : inta ; While (a ) stands true printf ( d ,a); print a ; a Output : Chapter : Looping Entry Controlled Loop -for loop The For Statement : Chapter : Looping Entry Controlled Loop -for loop for-loops are counter -controlled ,meaning that they are normally used whenever the number ofiterations isknown inadvance . where again the body can beeither asingle statement ora block ofstatements within curly braces .
