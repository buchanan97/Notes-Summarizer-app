X B where M is the slope and B is the intercept on the Y -axis (or Y -intercept). The capital forms of Y and X are chosen to represent a ny arbitrary variables we choose to plot. For example we may choose to plot position, x, on the Y -axis versus mass, m, on the X -axis, so we need different symbols for our general case. Refer to Figure to see what is being done. We choose two points, (X1 , Y1) and (X2, Y2), from the straight line that are not data points and that lie near opposite ends of the line so that a precise slope can be calculated. (Y2 -Y1) is called the rise of the line, while (X2 -X1) is the run. The slope is X XYYM Slope The point where the line crosses the vertical axis is called the intercept (or the Y - intercept). The interc ept has the same units as the vertical axis. The equation of the straight line with Y on the vertical axis and X on the horizontal axis is The line can be extended to cross the horizontal axis as well. The value of X where this happens is called the X -intercept, with the same units as variable X, and will be used only rarely. If the line goes directly through the origin, with intercepts of zero, we say that Y is directly proportional to X. The word proportional implies that not only is there a linear (straight line) relation between Y and X, but also that the intercept is zero.
