modular, easy to understand and debug . Chapter : User -Defined Functions Passing data to Functions Pass by Values ( also known as Call by Value) Incall byvalues, only thecopy ofthevalues ofvariables ispassed tothecalled function and that function works with the copies ofthe values and not onthe original variables . Pass by Address (also known as Call by Pointers, sometimes mistakenly called Call by Reference) Incall bypointers, the addresses ofthe variables are passed tothe called function and hence any changes made tothe values using pointer variables will change theoriginal values ofthepassed variables . Chapter : User -Defined Functions Functions returning multiple values (call by pointers reference) Chapter : User -Defined Functions Nesting of Functions function1() function1 body here function2(); function1 body here Nesting offunctions iscalling one function from inside the body ofanother . Careful when nesting functions asthis can lead toinfinite nesting . Chapter : User -Defined Functions Recursion Recursion isaspecial case ofnested functions inwhich a function calls itself from inside it sown body . We must have certain conditions inthe function tobreak out oftherecursion, otherwise recursion will occur infinite times . Inthefollowing slide wewill see anexample ofhow touse recursion tofind thefactorial ofanumber . Chapter : User -Defined Functions Recursion Chapter : User -Defined Functions Recursion Pros and Cons Recursive functions can be effectively used tosolve problems where solution can beexpressed interms of successively applying that same solution tosubsets ofthe problem . Recursion can reduce time complexity .But may increase it ifnotused properly . Recursion can reduce the size ofthe code and make debugging easier . Recursion uses more memory during execution ofthe program . Chapter : User -Defined Functions Passing arrays to Functions as Arguments We will only send
