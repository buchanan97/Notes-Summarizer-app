temperature T is higher than its surrounding s temperature T0, as per the Newton s law of cooling the rate of loss of heat ; ( 0) ( ) Where k is a positive proportionality constant. Since the temperature of the body is higher than the temperature of the surroundings then T -T0 is positive. Also the temperature of the body is decreasing i.e. it is cooling down and rate of change of temperature is negative. Also ( ) Considering equation no. ( ) and ( ) ( 0) ( ) where k is the constant of proportionality and k k m S is another constant (The term m S also includes the water equivalent of the calorimeter with which the experiment is performed). Negative sign appears in Eqs . ( ) and ( ) because loss of heat implies temperature decrease. Eq. ( ) may be re written as k ( 0) 0 .( ) On integration, ln( 0) log ( 0) log ( 0) ( ) Applying initial conditions; 1 2 Substituting the value of C in equation ( ) gives 2 ( 1 2) This equation represents Newton s law of cooling. If k , lim , and T T , or we can say that the temperature of the body approaches that of its surroundings as time goes. The graph drawn between the temperature of the body and time is known as cooling curve. The slope of the tangent to the curve at any point gives the rate of fall of temperature. In general, T(t) TA (TH TA)e kt ( ) Where, T (t) Temperature at time t, TA Ambient temperature (temp of surroundings), TH Temperature
