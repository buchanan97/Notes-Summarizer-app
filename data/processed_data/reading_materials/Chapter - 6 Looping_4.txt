exit control loop. It is a variation of while loop. When we want to execute or perform some task at least for once, we can use do while loop structure. In a while loop if the expression becomes false at very first try then loop will never be executed. Since, do while is of type exit control loop it checks the condition at last so, first time the loop will be execute unconditionally. If the condition for the exit becomes true then loop will be terminate otherwise it will be executed for the next time.
