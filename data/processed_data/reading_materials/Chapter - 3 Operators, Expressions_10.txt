Chapter : Operators and Expression in C The sizeof operator It is a compile time operator and, when used with an operand, it returns the number of bytes the operand occupies. The operand may be a variable, a constant or a data type qualifier. Examples: m sizeof(sum); n sizeof(long int); Chapter : Operators and Expression in C - Sample Programs This section contains several programs that you should study forprogramming technique and style .
