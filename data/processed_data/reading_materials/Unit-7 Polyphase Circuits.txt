[SOURCE: B.Tech CS Materials] Prepared by: Jigar Sarda M V Patel Department of Electrical Engineering jigarsarda.ee charusat.ac.in The generator producing asingle -phase supply hasonly one armature winding . But ifthegenerator isarranged tohave three separate but identical winding displaced degree apart androtate ina common magnetic field, itproduces three voltages ofsame magnitude and frequency but displaced by120 degree electrical from one another .This iscalled athree -phase system . .Constant Power :-Inasingle phase system, output power varies sinusoidally atafrequency twice thesupply frequency . This pulsating nature ofcurrent isharmful tosome applications whereas thebalanced -phase system supplies constant current atall instants oftime. .Self start :-The -phase systems areselfstarting asthey donot require anystarting device . However, single phase systems require starting device . .Greater output :-The power generated bya3-phase system is greater than thatofasingle phase system foragiven volume and weight ofthegenerator . This isthedistinct advantages over thesingle phase generator .More economical :-The -phase system ismuch smaller andless expensive than single phase system because lessmaterial isrequired foragiven output power atagiven voltage . .Less voltage drop :-Thevoltage drop from thegenerator totheload islessina3-phase system incomparison tothesingle -phase system .Power transmission economics :-The conductor material required totransmit agiven power atagiven voltage ofmaterial required in single phase system . This means asaving inmaterial andstrength oftransmitting towers . .High Efficiency :-The -phase motors areefficient and have a higher power factor than single phase motors ofthesame capacity . Inthree phase system, there arethree voltages having same magnitude andfrequency displaced byanelectrical angle of 120degree . They are attaining their positive maximum value ina particular order . The order inwhich voltages inthethree -phase attain their maximum positive value isknown asphase sequence . Theemfacross each winding iscalled phase voltage . They aredenoted by , and .
