[SOURCE: B.Tech CS Materials] CE143: COMPUTER CONCEPTS PROGRAMMING Chapter Looping Devang Patel Institute of Advance Technology and Research Objectives To learn about repetition (looping) control structures, i.e.while, forand do while To Examine break and continue statements Todiscover how toform and use nested control structures Chapter : Looping Introduction Inthis chapter, wewill discuss Need of looping (pre -test) entry -controlled loop: while, for, (post -test) exit - controlled loop: do while, difference Use of sentinel values. Nesting of looping statements use of break continue use of if else in loop infinite loop. Chapter : Looping Need of Looping Allow you toefficiently use variables Itcan input, add, and average multiple numbers using a limited number ofvariables Example : Chapter : Looping Add Five Numbers Declare a variable for each number, input the numbers and add the variables together Create a loop that reads a number into a variable and adds it to a variable that contains the sum of the numbers Depending on the position of the control statement in the loop, a control structure may be classified into two categories.Loop Control Structures Loop Structure Entry Controlled Loop Exit Controlled Loop Chapter : Looping Loop Control Structures Entry Controlled Loop Exit Controlled Loop Chapter : Looping A looping process, would include the following steps. . Setting and initialization of a condition variable . Execution of the statements in the loop . Test for a specified value of the condition variable for execution of the loop. . Incrementing or updating the condition variable Loop Control Structures Chapter : Looping Loop Control Structures Loops while for do..while Chapter : Looping Entry Controlled Loop -while loop The while loop is the simplest looping structure If
