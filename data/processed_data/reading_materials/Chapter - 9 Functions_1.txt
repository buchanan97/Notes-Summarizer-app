.No communication can take place directly between modules that don t have acalling -called relationship . .Allmodules are designed assingle -entry, single - exit systems using control structures . Chapter : User -Defined Functions Advantages of Modularization High level logic oftheoverall problem issolved first . Length ofasource program can bereduced . Easy tolocate and isolate afaulty function . Function mybeused bymany other programs . Instead of starting all over again from scratch, programmers can use already built functions . Chapter : User -Defined Functions Elements of user -defined functions .Function Definition .Function Call .Function Declaration Chapter : User -Defined Functions Definition of functions A function definition also known as function implementation shall have thefollowing elements : .Function Name .Function Type (Return Type) .List of Parameters .Local Variable Declarations .Function Statements .AReturn Statement Allthese elements aregrouped together into two sections : . Function Header (First three elements) . Function Body (Second three elements) Chapter : User -Defined Functions Definition of functions return Type function Name (type1 argument1, type2 argument2, ) Local Variable Decalarations Body ofthefunction Return statement Formal Parameter List The formal parameters list declares the variables that will receive the data sent by the calling function The function type or the return type specifies the data type of the value that the function is expected to return to the calling function. Chapter : User -Defined Functions Return Statement Areturn statement immediately transfers control ofthe program tothecalling function . Itcan beplaced anywhere inthefunction body . Itcan have thefollowing forms : return ; simple, returns nodata, acts like aclosing brace return(expression) ; returns the value ofthe expression tothe calling function Areturn statement can also beused inthefollowing way : If(condition) return ; Chapter
