Apparatus Hooke s law apparatus (mirror scale, spring, slotted weights with hanger and pointer, complete tripod stand), Digital stop watch. Pictorial Diagram Hook s Law Set up Hooke s Law Inthe 1600 s,ascientist called Robert Hooke discovered alaw forelastic materials . Hooke's achievements were extraordinary -he made the first powerful microscope and wrote the first scientific best-seller, Micrographia . Hooke's Law, elastic and plastic behaviour Ifamaterial returns toitsoriginal size and shape when you remove theforces stretching itwesay that the material -elastic behaviour . Aplastic (orinelastic) material isonethat stays deformed after youhave taken theforce away -plastic behaviour . Ifyouapply toobigaforce amaterial willlose itselasticity . Hooke discovered that the amount aspring stretches is proportional totheamount offorce applied toit.This means if youdouble theforce itsextension willdouble, ifyoutriple theforce theextension willtriple andsoon. Hooke s Law Hooke's Law gives the relationship between the force applied to an unstretched spring andthe amount the spring is stretched Hooke's Law states :- the extension is proportional totheforce thespring willgoback to its original length when theforce isremoved so long as we don't exceed theelastic limit. Hooke s Law F -k x F restoring force of spring x the distance that the spring has been stretch or compressed from equilibrium k the spring constant (-) force acts in opposite direction of the displacement Hooke s Law Hooke s Law Hooke s Law Hooke s Law Hooke s Law Hooke s Law Hooke s Law K Spring Constant? Thespring constant measures how stiffthespring is.
