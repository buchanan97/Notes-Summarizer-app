a current will be induced too. magnet stationary, coil moves coil stationary, magnet moves, coil stationary, magnetic field lines changing (By rotating the coil relative to magnetic field) Induced EMF is proportional to the rate at which field lines are cut . Lenz s Law : The induced current always flows in such a direction as to oppose the change which causes it. Faraday's second law of electromagnetic induction states that, the magnitude of induced emf is equal to the rate of change of flux linkages with the coil. The flux linkages is the product of number of turns and the flux associated with the coil. Faraday s 2ndlawofelectromagnetic induction Consider, a magnet is approaching towards a coil. Here we consider two instants at time T1 and time T2. Fleming s Left Hand Rule and Fleming s Right Hand Rule TYPES OF INDUCED EMF Whenever there isachange offlux linkages with acoil ora conductor ane.m.f.isproduced init. This change influx linkages can beobtained inthefollowing two ways . i)The conductor ismoved inastationary magnetic field insuch away that there ismagnitude change influx linkages .This kind ofinduced e.mf.isknown asdynamically induced e.m.f.e.g. generators . (ii)When theconductor isstationary and flux linking with the conductor undergoes achange .ane.m.f.isinduced inthe conductors .This kind ofinduced e.m.f.istermed asstatically induced e.m.f.Statically induced e.m.f.can befurther classified asselfinduced e.m.f.and (ii)mutually induced e.m.f. Dynamically or Mutual Induced EMF Dynamically induced e.m.f.isproduced bythe movement ofthe conductor inamagnetic field .The reverse isalso true . The movement oftheconductor must besuch that theflux iscutby theconductor . Fig. .43shows auniform magnetic field offlux density BWb m . The conductor ismoving atright angle tothemagnetic field ata velocity vm sec asshown inthe Fig. (a). Astheconductor moves atright angle tothefield, theflux iscutby the
