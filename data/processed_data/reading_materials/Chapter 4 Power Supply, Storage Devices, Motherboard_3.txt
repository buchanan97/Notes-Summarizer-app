orbattery tomains changeover time inoffline UPS isvery lowascompared toinverter . Typically, changeover time ininverters is500 milliseconds Offline UPS has change over time of3-8milliseconds . Offline UPS Inatime, when mains acispresent, Inverter provides theoutput asistheinput mains . While, Offline UPS hasbuilt in Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) toregulate theoutput voltage close to220 Vac. Offline UPSs arenormal weight UPSs andarewidely used fordomestic computers . Inthistype of UPS, thesystem always remains onbattery, whether mains acispresent ornot. When mains acispresent, itprovides power to DCsupply ofinverter section aswell ascharges thebattery simultaneously . When mains acisnotpresent, itwillruntheconnected load tillthebattery hasarecommended dischargeable level . Stabilizer Thefunction ofavoltstabilizer istomaintain aconstant voltage level . Itcontains electromechanical orelectronic components toregulate oneormore AC or DCvoltages . Electronic voltage stabilizers stabilize DCvoltages used byelectrical elements in gadgets anddevices thus protecting household appliances from voltage surges that destroy it. Continue Thepurpose ofavoltage stabilizer istomaintain anoutput thatisclose tothe normal mains voltage aspossible, under conditions offluctuation . Different voltage stabilizers areused fordifferent appliance according tothe specification andusage ofeach device . There are TVStabilizers, Refrigerator Stabilizers, Stabilizers forwashing machines, music systems, andspecialized voltage stabilizers fordigital TV s, LEDTV s and LCDTV s . Types of Memory Computer memory is broadly categorized into two types: Primary Storage i.e Main Memory, and Secondary Storage i.e Auxillary Memory Primary storage is closely connected to the CPU and is used for temporary storage of data and instructions during processing. Secondary storage is relatively permanent but further away'' from the CPU. Primary storage is fast; secondary storage is slow (relatively). Primary storage is volatile (i.e. contents are lost when power is removed); Secondary storage is non-volatile . Primary storage is based on electronic technology; Secondary storage is usually based on magnetic (or
