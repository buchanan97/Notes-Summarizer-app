screen might not beasbright asthe other parts of thescreen . main advantages :energy saving, ultra -thin, light leakage control isbetter . Plasma Screen Monitor Also called gas -discharge display About 6inches (15cm) thick . The basic idea ofaplasma display istoilluminate tiny, colored fluorescent lights toform animage .Each pixel ismade upofthree fluorescent lights --aredlight, agreen light and ablue light . Just likea CRT television, theplasma display varies theintensities ofthedifferent lights toproduce afullrange ofcolors . Aflat-screen technology that uses tiny cells lined with phosphor that are full ofinert ionized gas (typically amix ofxenon and neon) .Three cells make upone pixel (one cellhas redphosphor, one green, one blue) .The cells aresandwiched between x-and yaxis panels, and acell isselected bycharging the appropriate x and yelectrodes .The charge causes the gas inthe cell toemit ultraviolet light, which causes the phosphor toemit color .The amount ofcharge determines theintensity, and thecombination ofthedifferent intensities ofred, green and blue produce allthe colors required . OLED (organic light -emitting diode) Monitor Organic light emitting diodes arearelatively new technology forsolid state light sources . Atypical OLED consists oftwo organic layers (electron and hole transport layers), embedded between two electrodes . The topelectrode isusually ametallic mirror with high reflectivity and the bottom electrode atransparent ITOlayer ontopoftheglass substrate . Itdoes nothave carbon inmaterial . Faults of Monitor Power light does not come on when monitor is switched on. Power light isonorflashing, butmonitor isstillblank . Monitor display iswildly inaccurate (nothing can be made outatall.) Monitor display isslightly inaccurate (the proper display isthere, butcorrupted somehow .) Display isnotstable . Diagonal lines arepresent . Screen isflickering . Nocontrol over brightness . Focus isnotproper . . Display Card of Monitor Projector Adevice that isused toproject rays oflight,
