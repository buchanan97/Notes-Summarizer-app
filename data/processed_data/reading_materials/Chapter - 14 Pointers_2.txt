pointer Declares the variable a as a pointer variable that points to an integer datatype . The type int refers tothe data type ofthe variable being pointed tobyaand not the type ofthe value of the pointer Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Declaring Pointer Variable -Pointer declaration style Pointers variables are declared similarly as normal variables except for the addition of the unary operator. int p; int p; Style - Style - int p, x, q; intx, p, y; x ; p x; y p; Accessing x through p p ; Accessing to x Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Initialization of Pointer Variable Process of assigning the address of a variable to a pointer variable is known as initialization Once pointer variable has been declared we can use the assignment operator to initialize the variable intquantity; int p; declaration p quantity; initialization or int p quantity Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Initialization of Pointer Variable Pointer variables always point to the corresponding type of data For example, float a,b; intx, p; p a; Wrong b p; Will result in erroneous output because we are trying to assign the address of a float variable to an integer pointer Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Initialization of Pointer Variable We could define apointer variable with aninitial value of NULL or0. int p NULL ; int p ; With the exception of NULL and ,no other constant value can be assigned toapointer variable . For example, following iswrong : int p 5360 ; absolute address Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Initialization of Pointer Variable -Pointer Flexibility Same Pointer to different data variables in different statement.
