than aswitched mode power supply . Aswitched mode power supply ismore power efficient than alinear power supply . Aswitched mode power supply ismore likely tocreate interference than alinear power supply . The main disadvantage ofaswitched mode power supply compared toalinear power supply isnoise .The voltage oscillations andtheconstant connecting and disconnecting from thesource create toomuch electrical noise thatcaninterfere with other nearby electronics . UPS Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) orbattery backup, isused toprovide a backup power source toimportant desktop computer hardware components . UPS isadevice thatallows your computer tokeep running foratleast ashort time when theprimary power source islost. UPS notifies you ofthepower loss, you have time tosave any data you are working onandexitgracefully before thesecondary power source (the battery) runs out. Many UPSs now offer asoftware component that enables you to automate backup andshut down procedures incase there's apower failure while you're away from thecomputer . Need of UPS Modern Electronic gadgets andcomputer systems arehighly sensitive tothepower fluctuations Disruption ofpower may lead to Data loss corruption malfunction etc. Starting thegenerator takes afewminutes .UPS ismainly used asa Power Backup for theabove fewminutes UPS maintains power instantaneously byswitching tobattery intheevent ofapower failure oradip(brown out) Two basic types of UPS systems :standby power systems (SPSs) and on-line UPS systems . An SPS monitors thepower lineandswitches tobattery power assoon asitdetects a problem . The switch tobattery, can require several milliseconds, during which time the computer isnot receiving any power .Standby Power Systems are sometimes called Line -interactive UPSes . Anon-line UPS avoids these momentary power lapses byconstantly providing power from itsown inverter, even when thepower lineisfunctioning properly .Ingeneral, online UPSs aremuch more expensive than SPSs .
