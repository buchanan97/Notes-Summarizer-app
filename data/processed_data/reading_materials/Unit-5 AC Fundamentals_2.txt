ofalternating voltage orcurrent is given by: where, f frequency, P no.ofpoles ofthealternator, N speed ofthealternator inrpm14 .Angular Frequency: - Angular frequency ofan alternating quantity is defined as where, fisthefrequency and Tisatime period . .Phase :- Itisdefined asthefractional part ofthecycle through which thealternating quantity has advanced from the origin(reference point) . The phase atany instant tfrom that instant where time iszero, isgiven by1 T, where Tbethe time period ofalternating current . .Phase Angle: - Itisdefined asthephase measured interms ofangle . The phase angle atany instant tisgiven by2 T t. Itismeasured interms ofelectrical degrees . .Phase Difference :- The phase difference between two alternating quantities having same frequency isthedifference of planes atthemaximum orzero orminimum value of thetwo alternating quantities . (a) Two alternating quantities are called in phase, when they attain maximum values orzero values atthesame instant . (b)Two alternating quantities are called out ofphase when one alternating quantity attains maximum ananother minimum atthesame instant . Equation of alternating voltage(e.m.f) Arectangular coil AChaving Nturns and rotating ina uniform magnetic field with aconstant angular velocity inanti-clockwise direction isshown infig. The emf induced intheside Aofthecoil isentirely due tothe component ofvelocity perpendicular tothe magnetic field i.e.Vsin Hence, theemf induced inone side ofthecoil attime t isgiven by, Total emf generated inboth sides ofthecoil is Ifthecoil has Nturns inseries, thetotal emf induced inthecoil atany instant tisgiven by20 The coil makes frevolutions persecond .So,thelinear distance travelled persecond orperipheral velocity vis given by Substituting thevalue ofv, When varies from 0to180,the emf isconsidered positive and it isnegative when varies b w to360. Thus, in one cycle of the waveform, there isone positive half-cycle and one negative halfcycle . The number ofsuch complete cycles that occur inone second is called thefrequency
