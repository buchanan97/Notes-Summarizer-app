water, times change in temperature of the water, times specific heat of the water (which is always cal g o C for water). When a heated metal cube transfers its heat to a sample of water, in a perfectly insulated container, the heat absorbed by the water must be exactly equal to the heat given off by the metal cube. There is a perfect transfer of energy from the cube to the water. q(water) - q(metal). You can use this relationship to determine the heat capacity of a metal. Procedure . Measure m L (exactly) of room temperature water in the volumetric cylinder. Use the known density of water to determine the mass of this water. Pour the water into the plastic cup. Record the temperature of this water at room temperature. This is yo ur starting temperature for the water. . Choose one of the metal cubes. Record what type of metal it is (copper, iron, brass, aluminum , or anyother ). And determine its weight. . Place the metal cube carefully in the bottom of the glass beaker. Don t break th e beaker. Fill the beaker with enough tap water to cover the metal cube. Heat the beaker and its contents on the hot plate, until it approaches boiling. . Just before taking the metal cube out of the boiling water, measure the temperature of the hot water. You can treat this measurement as the starting temperature of the metal block, since you have no other means to measure the internal temperature of a solid block. . Take the metal cube out of the hot water, and transfer it immediately to the plastic cup. Stir the water
