Apparatus Hooke s law apparatus (mirror scale, spring, slotted weights with hanger and pointer, complete tripod stand), Digital stop watch. Pictorial Diagram Pictorial Diagram of Hooke s Law Theory Introduction to Uncertainties and Error Propagation To study the properties of springs and the motion of a mass attached to a spring and all types of linear forces. We support the spring from above and stretch it by hanging different masses on the bottom end, as shown in Figure . We obtained by calculating the differences in position of the spring mark with and without the hanging weight to obtain the displacement from the starting position with no hanging weight. In each case, the hanging weight is in equilibrium, supported by an equal upward force due to the spring. We observed from our results that the force that the spring exerts on the hanging mass is proportio nal to its displacement x from its unstretched equilibrium length, F k x ( ) Where k is called the spring constant. The negative sign indicates that the spring force is a restoring force; if the spring is stretched, the spring force tends to pull it back to a shorter length, whereas if compressed to a shorter length, the spring force tends to restore it to its longer equilibrium length. Equation ( ) is known as Hooke s law and correctly describes the spring force fo r small displacements. Fig Schematic of Hooke s law An additional approach is possible. One definition of simple harmonic motion (SHM) is that it is motion under a linear, Hooke's Law restoring force. For such a
