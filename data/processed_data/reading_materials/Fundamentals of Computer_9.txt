semiconductors, which drastically increased the speed and efficiency of computers. Computer chips, both for CPU and memory, are composed of semiconductor materials. Semiconductors make impossible to miniaturize electronic components, such as transistors . Not only does miniaturization mean that the components take up less space, it also means that they are faster and require less energy. Fourth Generation - 1971 -Present: Microprocessors The microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers , as thousands of integrated circuits were built onto a single silicon chip. A silicon chip that contains a CPU. In the world of personal computers, the terms microprocessor and CPU are used interchangeably . At the heart of all personal computers and most workstations sits a microprocessor. Microprocessors also control the logic of almost all di gital devices, from clock radios to fuel-injection systems for automobiles. Fifth Generation - Present and Beyond: Artificial Intelligence Fifth generation computing devices, based inartificial intelligence, are still in development, though there are some applications, such as voice recognition , that are being used today. Artificial Intelligence is the branch of computer science concerned with making computers behave like humans . Artificial intelligence includes: Games Playing : programming computers to play games such as chess and checkers Expert Systems : programming computers to make decisions in real -life situations (for example, some expert systems help doctors diagnose diseases based on symptoms ) Natural Language : programming computers to understand natural human languages CLASSIFICATION OF COMPUTERS The computers can be classified under the following basis. They are: Classif ication according to their size Mainframe Computer Mini Computer Micro Computer Super Computer Classification according t o their Work Analog Computer Digital Computer Hybrid Computer Mainframe computer
