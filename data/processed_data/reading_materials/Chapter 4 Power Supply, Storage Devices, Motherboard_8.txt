IDE-Integrated Development Environment SATA -Serial Advanced Technology Attachment ATA -Advanced Technology Attachment RAID -Redundant Array Of Inexpensive Disks CMOS -complementary metal -oxide semiconductor BIOS -Basic Input Output System SCSI Small Computer System Interface Motherboard Itisa Printed Circuit Board (PCB) where allthecomponents ofa system areconnected . The Central Processing Unit (CPU), hard drives, memory and every other part ofasystem isconnected tothemotherboard by means ofslots, connectors and sockets . The motherboard chipset isaseries ofchips that areapart ofthe motherboard . Motherboard Types of Motherboards Types of Motherboard Description AT Oldest type ofmotherboard stillused insome system Uses P8and P9power connections Measures .5cmx33cm(12x13inches) Baby AT Smaller version of AT.Small size ispossible because motherboard logic isstored onasmall chip set. Uses P8and P9power connections . Measures 33cmx22cm(12x8.7inches) ATX Developed byintel for Pentium System . Has amore conveniently accessible layout than ATboards . Includes apower -onswitch that can besoftware enabled and extra power connections forextra fans Uses P1connectors Measures .5cmx24.4cm(12x9.6inches) Mini ATX An ATX board with amore compact design Measures .4cmx20.8cm( .2x8.2inches) Functional block diagram of motherboard North Bridge (Host Bridge North Chipset) A north bridge or host bridge is amicrochip on some PCmotherboards and isconnected directly tothe CPU (unlike the Southbridge) . The Northbridge isusually paired with a Southbridge ,also known as I Ocontroller hub. Insystems where they are included, these two chips manage communications between the CPU and other parts ofthe motherboard, and constitute the core logic chipset ofthe PC motherboard . Itisresponsible forcontrol ofhigh speed components like CPU, RAM, and Video Card . CPU The Central Processing Unit (CPU) isthechip onthemotherboard that acts asthe"computer's brain" Itdoes calculations, and coordinates theother motherboard components CPU examples :Pentium, core i3,i7. The CPU isalso known astheprocessor ormicroprocessor . CPU
