foruse throughout your code . The syntax forcreating aconstant using define inthe Clanguage is: define CNAME value OR define CNAME (expression) CNAME : The name oftheconstant . Most Cprogrammers define their constant names in uppercase, but itisnot a requirement of the C Language .value : Thevalue oftheconstant . expression : Expression whose value is assigned totheconstant . The expression must be enclosed inparentheses ifit contains operators . Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C define Directive -Example include stdio .h define NAME "Charusat" define YEAR 2000 intmain() printf(" sisestablished inyear d n",NAME, YEAR) ; return ; Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Difference between define const The bigadvantage ofconst over define istype checking . We can typecast them and any other thing that can bedone with a normal variable . One disadvantage that one could think ofisextra space forvariable which isimmaterial due tooptimizations done bycompilers . Ingeneral const isabetter option ifwe have achoice .There are situations when define cannot bereplaced byconst .For example, define can take parameters . define can also beused toreplace some text inaprogram with another text . Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Declaring a variable as volatile ANSI standard defines another qualifier, volatile that could beused to tell explicitly the compiler that avariable's value may bechanged at any time bysome external sources . Bydeclaring avariable asvolatile ,itsvalue may bechanged atany time bysome external source . Example : volatile intdate ; The date may bealtered bysome external factors even ifitdoes not appear onthelefthand side ofassignment statement . Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Overflow and Underflow of Data Based onthe storage size ofdata types inany particular system there isafixed range
