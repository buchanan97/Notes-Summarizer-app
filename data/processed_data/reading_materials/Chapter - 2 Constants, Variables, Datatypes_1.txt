Every smallest individual unit ofacprogram iscalled token . Every instruction inacprogram isacollection oftokens . Tokens are used toconstruct cprograms and they are said tothebasic building blocks ofacprogram . Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C C Tokens Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Keywords Keywords are the reserved words with predefined meaning which already known tothecompiler . Properties of Keywords Allthe keywords are defined aslowercase letters sothey must be use only inlowercase letters Every keyword has aspecific meaning, users can not change that meaning . Keywords can not beused asuser defined names like variable, functions, arrays, pointers etc Every keyword represents something orspecifies some kind of action tobeperformed bythecompiler . Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Keywords Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Identifiers Identifier is a user defined name of an entity to identify it uniquely during the program execution. Example: int marks; char student Name ; Here, marks and student Name are identifiers. Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Identifiers Rules forcreating Identifiers An identifier can contain letters (UPPERCASE and lowercase), numerics underscore symbol only . Anidentifier should notstart with numerical value .Itcan start with aletter oranunderscore . We should not use any special symbols inbetween the identifier even whitespace .However, theonly underscore symbol isallowed . Keywords should notbeused asidentifiers . There isnolimit for length ofanidentifier .However, compiler consider first 31characters only . Anidentifier must beunique initsscope .
