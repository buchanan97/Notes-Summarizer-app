Address starts from zero .Last address depends on memory size . Computer having Kmemory will have itslast address , . At the declaration time systems allocates, some appropriate location tohold thevalue ofthevariable Chapter : Pointers Variables that hold memory addresses are called pointer variables. Chapter :User -Defined Functions Introduction Pointers are variables that contain memory addresses as their values. A variable name directly references a value. A pointer indirectly references a value. Referencing a value through a pointer is called indirection . A pointer variable must be declared before it can be used.
