[SOURCE: B.Tech CS Materials] Algorithm Flowchart Manual CIC-UHF ALGORITHM FLOWCHART MANUAL for STUDENTS (Ravi K. Walia) Assistant Professor Incharge Computer Instrumentation Centre Dr. Y. S. Parmar University of Horticulture Forestry, Nauni Solan INDIA (HP) Algorithm Flowchart Manual CIC-UHF PREFACE This document has been prepared for students at Dr. Y. S. Parmar University of Horticulture Forestry, Nauni, Solan (HP) India. Software Engineer uses various programming languages to create programs. Before writing a program , first needs to find a pr ocedure for solving the problem. The program written without proper pre -planning has higher chances of errors. Algorithm and flowchart are the powerful tools for learning programming. An algorithm is a step-by-step analysis of the process, while a flowchart explains the steps of a program in a graphical way. Algorithm and flowcharts helps to clarify all the steps for solving the problem. For beginners , it is always recommended to first write algorithm and draw flowchart for solving a problem and then only wr ite the program. Beginners find it difficult to write algorithm and draw flowchart. The algorithm can vary from person to person to solve a particular problem. The manual will be useful for the students to learn algorithm and flowchart . It includes basics of algorithm and flowchart along with number of examples . Software Click Charts by NCH (unlicensed version) has been used to draw all the flowcharts in the manual. Algorithm Flowchart Manual CIC-UHF .. ALGORITHM : The word algorithm relates to the name of the mathematician Al -khowarizmi, which means a procedure or a technique. Software Engineer commonly uses an algorithm for planning and solving the problems . An algorithm is a sequence of steps
