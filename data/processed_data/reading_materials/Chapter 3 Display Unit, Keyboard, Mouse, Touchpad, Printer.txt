The heated filament isinavacuum created inside a glass"tube . The "ray" isastream ofelectrons generated byan electron gun that naturally pour offaheated cathode into thevacuum . Electrons are negative .The anode ispositive, soit attracts theelectrons pouring offthecathode . This screen iscoated with phosphor ,anorganic material that glows when struck bytheelectron beam . Video of CRT LCD (Liquid Crystal Diode) Monitor Non selfilluminating . Require aback light forproducing apicture . Backlit s from CCFLs .(Cold Cathode Florescent Lamps) These lights bear resemblance of Florescent tubes used forlighting . They arearranged horizontal behind thescreen . -2inch thick . LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) LED (Light -emitting diode) Monitor Precisely called as LED -backlit LCDmonitor More energy efficient than CCFLs . Allconsumer level "LED monitors" donot have afullarray backlight .Instead they are edge litwhich means the LED lights runs around theedge ofthe LCD panel .This allows for athinner LED lights areused toprovide the backlight and they aredesign and helps reduce power consumption . The draw back itthat you arelikely tosee more "backlight bleeding" around theedges ofthemonitor and thecenter ofthe
