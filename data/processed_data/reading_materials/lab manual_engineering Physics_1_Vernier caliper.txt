There is always an uncertainty associated with any measured quantity in an experiment even in the most carefully done experiment and despite using the most sophisticated instrument s. This uncertainty in the measured value is known as the error in that particular measured quantity. There is no way by which one can measure a quantity with one hundred percent accuracy. In presenting experimental results it is very important to objectiv ely estimate the error in the measured result. Such an exercise is very basic to experimental science. The importance of characterizing the accuracy and reliability of an experimental result is difficult to understate when we keep in mind that it is experi mental evidence that validate scientific theories. Likewise, reliability and accuracy of measurements are also deeply relevant to Engineering. When a measurement of a physical quantity is repeated, the results of the various measurements will, in general, spread over a range of values. This spread in the measured results is due to the errors in the experiment. Errors are generally classified into two types: systematic (or determinate) errors and random (or indeterminate) errors. A systematic error is an er ror, which is constant throughout a set of readings. Systematic errors lead to a clustering of the measured values around a value displaced from the "true"
