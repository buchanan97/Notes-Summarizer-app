by the thermometer T2. . Record observations in tabular form. Find the excess of temperature ( T T0) and also log10 ( T T0) for each reading, using logarithmic tables. Record these values in the corresponding columns in the table. . Plot a graph betwee n time t, taken along x -axis and log10 ( T To) taken along y-axis. Interpret the graph. Precaution . The water in the calorimeter should be gently stirred continuously. . Ideally the space between the double walls of the surrounding vessel should be filled with flowing water to make it an enclosure having a constant temperature. . Make sure that the openings for inserting thermometers are air tight and no heat is lost to the surroundings through these. . The start ing temperature of water in the calorimeter should be about C above the room temperature.
