[SOURCE: B.Tech CS Materials] Experiment AIM VERIFICATION OF NEWTON S LAW OF COOLING . Apparatus Newton s law of cooling apparatus that includes a copper calorimeter with a wooden lid having two holes for inserting a thermometer and a stirrer and an open double walled vessel, two Celsius thermometers (each with least count C or C), a stop clock watch, a heater burner, liquid (water), a clamp stand, two rubber stoppers with holes, strong cotton thread and a beaker. Pictorial Diagram Pictorial Diagram of newton s cooling law Theory Temperature difference in any situation results from energy flow into a system or energy flow from a system to surroundings. The forme r leads to heating, whereas lat er leads to cooling of an object. Newton s Law of Cooling states that the rate of temperature of the body is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the body and that of the surrounding medium. This statement leads to the classic equation of exponential decline over time which can be applied to many phenomena in science and engineering, including the discha rge of a capacitor and the decay in radioactivity. Newton's Law of Cooling is useful for studying water heating because it can tell us how fast the hot water in pipes cools off. A practical application is that it can tell us how fast a water heater cools down if you turn off the breaker when you go on vacation. Newton s Law of Cooling : The rate of loss of heat energy is proportional to the temperature difference between the hot surface and the surroundings. For a body of mass m and specific heat S, at its initial
