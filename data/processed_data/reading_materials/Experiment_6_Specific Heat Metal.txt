[SOURCE: B.Tech CS Materials] Specific heat of the metals Definition Heat is needed to warm up anything, but the amount of heat is not the same for all things. Therefore it is desirable to know the specific heat of a substance . The amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance by one Celsius degree is call the specific heat or specific heat capacity of that substance. Temperature change in K Heat energy in J Mass in kg Specific heat capacity in J K kg Heat Capacity and Specific Heat When heat energy flows into a substance, its temperature will increase The specific heat capacity is the heat energy (in J) needed to raise the temperature of kg of the substance by K Link to stimulator https: phet.colorado.edu sims html energy -forms -and-changes latest energy -forms -and-changes en.html Step Step Step Step Step Step Step Step Step Data tables Observation table Metal Metal
