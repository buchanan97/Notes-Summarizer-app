[SOURCE: B.Tech CS Materials] Devang Patel Institute of Advance Technology And Research CE143: COMPUTER CONCEPTS PROGRAMMING Chapter Character Arrays Objectives Tounderstand character array and importance of NULL character . Tounderstand Declaration, Initialization and various input and output methods ofstring, formatted output ofstring, arithmetic operations oncharacters . Tounderstand various functions ofstring .h:strlen, strcat, strcmp, strcpy, strrev, strstr, etc. To learn Two dimensional character array (table of strings) . Chapter : Character Arrays Introduction Asequence ofcharacters isoften referred toasacharacter string . Astring isstored inanarray of type char ending with the null character ' '. For example :The string "hello world" contains characters including ' 'character which is automatically added by the compiler attheend ofthestring . Chapter : Character Arrays Introduction Any group ofcharacters(except double quote sign) defined between double quotation marks isastring constant . Example : "Man isobviously made tothink ." Toadd double quotation inthe string tobeprinted, back slash will beused . Example : printf (" "Well Done! "); output :"Well Done!" Chapter : Character Arrays Importance of NULL character The terminating null( )isimportant, because itistheonly way the functions that work with astring can know where thestring ends . Infact, astring not terminated bya isnot really astring, but merely acollection ofcharacters . Memory Representation of String : Chapter : Character Arrays Declaration initializing string variables Character strings are often used tobuild meaningful and readable programs . The operations that areperformed oncharacter strings are Reading and writing strings . Combining strings together . Copying one string toanother . Comparing strings forequality . Extracting aportion ofastring . Chapter : Character Arrays Declaration initializing string variables Calso permits toinitialize acharacter array without specifying the number ofelements . char string 'G','O','O','D',' ' ; defines thearray string
