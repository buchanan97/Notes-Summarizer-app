m L3 l from load-depression graph Chosen value of load m on the graph (kg) Length L (m) Depression l from graph (m) m L3 l (kg.m2) Mean m L3 l (kg.m2) . Table Determination of Y L Mean m L3 l From table (kg.m2) b from table (m) d from table (m) Given g (m s2) Y (Pa) Experiments for B. Tech. 1st Year Physics Laboratory Department of Physics, IIT Roorkee Result: Young s modulus of material of bar is calculated as .. Computation and percentage error: We have lm bdg LY . ( ) The quantities L, b, d and l are measured in this experiment. Hence, the maximum probable error can be calculated as: ll dd bb LL YY )( )( ( ) Precautions: . In the expression of Y,L and d are in powers of three. But as d is much smaller, it should be carefully calculated to avoid maximum error in Y. . Care should be taken to make the beam horizontal and to load the bar at its mid-point. . Try to avoid parallax and back-lash errors during measurement.
