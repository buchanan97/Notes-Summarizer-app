called assembler to translate the machine level language. To high -level language , high - level language to machine level language vice-versa. Assembly level language is also called as MNEMONICS. Machine Le vel Language or Binary Language The computer easily understands the data given by the user in machine level language. The machine level language is a set of s and s. GENERATIONS OF COMPUTER First Generation - 1940 -1956: Vacuum Tubes The first computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory, and were often enormous, taking up entire rooms. A magnetic drum, also referred to as drum, is a metal cylinder coated with magnetic iron -oxide material on which data and programs can be stored. They were very expensive to operate and in addition to using a great deal of electricity, generated a lot of heat, which was often the cause of malfunctions. First generation computers relied on machine language to perform operations, and they could only solve one problem at a time. Machine languages are the only languages understood by computers. While easily und erstood by computers, machine languages are almost impossible for humans to use because they consist entirely of numbers. Programmers, therefore, use either a high -level programming language or an assembly language. An assembly language contains the same instructions as a machine language, but the instructions and variables have names instead of being just numbers. Programs written in high -level languages retranslated into assembly language or machine language by a compiler. Assembly language programs retranslated into machine language by a program called an assembler. The UNIVAC and ENIAC computers are examples of first - generation computing devices. The UNIVAC was the first
