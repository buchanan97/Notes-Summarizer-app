of Pointers Pointers Pointer Constants Pointer Values Pointer Variables Memory address within the computer We can not change them We can only use them to store data values Can t save the value of memory address directly Can only obtain the value through the variable stored there using the address operator ( ) Once we have a pointer value, it can be stored into another variable The variable that contains a pointer value is called as pointer variable. Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Accessing the concepts of a variable Actual location of a variable is system dependent immediately proceeding a variable returns the address of the variable. For example, p a. operator can be used with simple variable or array element. Following are illegal use: (Pointing at constants) intx ; x (Pointing at array names) (x y) (Pointing at expression) If x is an array, then expression such as x and x i Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions include stdio.h include conio.h void main() char a 'A'; intb ; float c , d ; clrscr (); printf ("a c a u n",a, a ); printf ("b d b u n",b, b ); printf ("c f c u n",c, c ); printf ("d f d u n",d, d ); getch (); Accessing the concepts of a variable Chapter : Pointers Chapter :User -Defined Functions Declaring Pointer Variable In c, variable must be declared. data type pt name ; This tells the compiler three things about the variable pt name . tells that pt name is pointer variable pt name needs memory location. pt name points to a variable of type data -type. For example, int a; integer
