A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. Pointers are used in C program to access th e memory and manipulate the address. Address in C You must have seen this notation while using scanf() function. It was used in the function to store the user inputted value in the address of var. scanf(" d", var); Example to demonstrate use of reference operator in C programming. include stdio.h int main() int var ; printf( "Value: d n", var); printf( "Address: u" , var); Notice, the ampersand( ) before var. return ; o p : Value: Address: 2686778 Understanding a pointer Whenever a variable is declared in a program, system allocates a location i.e an address to that variable in the memory, to hold the assigned value. This location has its own address number . Let us assume that system has allocated memory location F for a variable a. int a ; We can access the value either by using the variable name a or by using its address F. The question is how we can access a variable using it's address? Since the memory addresses are also just numbers, the
