The first dimension is called a plane, which consists of rows and columns. The C language considers the three -dimensional array to be an array of two -dimensional arrays. Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Multi -Dimensional Arrays (Topic not part of Syllabus) Chapter : Arrays Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Multi -Dimensional Arrays Chapter : Arrays Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Dynamic Arrays Chapter : Arrays Inthe programs seen inprevious slides, allmemory needs were determined before program execution bydefining thevariables needed
