ofvalues that can bestored inavariable ofagiven data types . Overflow :The assignment ofavalue larger than the storage capacity ofthedata type ofavariable can hold . Underflow :The assignment ofavalue smaller than the storage capacity ofthedata type ofavariable can hold . Cdoes not provide any warning orindication of Overflow and underflow, Itsimply gives incorrect results . So, Itisrecommended todefine correct data type for handling the input output values . Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Datatypes -Derived Datatypes Derived datatypes areuser -defined data types . The derived datatypes are also called asuser defined datatypes or secondary datatypes . Incprogramming language, the derived datatypes are created using thefollowing concepts Arrays Structures Unions Enumeration Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Previous Year Questions Classify following variables into valid invalid variable name in C. , (area), mark, 25th, , distance What are the advantages of user defined function? Classify between valid and Invalid variable names? RAM, ANSI, GJ India , Float variable, One int , ID Give difference between variables and constants. Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Previous Year Questions Why and When do we use the define directive? OR Explain define? What are trigraph characters? How are they useful? Explain C Tokens with example? Explain three types of datatypes with example? Is main() a user defined function? if yes how does it differ from other user -defined function? if No, give reason for it. Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C
