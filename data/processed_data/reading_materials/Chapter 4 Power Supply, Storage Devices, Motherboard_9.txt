Socket ACPU socket or CPU slot isa mechanical component that provides mechanical and electrical connections between amicroprocessor and aprinted circuit board (PCB) . This allows the CPU tobeplaced and replaced without soldering . Some Processors (CPUs) Power PC Chip Chip Fan Pentium Chip The first microprocessor was the Intel 4004 that was released November ,1971 and had , transistors and performed , operations persecond . The Intel Pentium Processor shown onthis slide has , , transistors and performs around , , , instructions per second . The CPU and RAM The CPU processes data.The RAM contains data and programs. The data bus transports the processed data to the RAM so it can be stored, displayed, or output. BIOS ABIOS (Basic Input Output System) isanelectronic setofinstructions that acomputer uses tosuccessfully start operating . Itgives basic information about how tointeract with some critical components, such asdrives and memory . The BIOS contains allthe code required tocontrol the keyboard, display screen, disk drives, serial communications, and anumber of miscellaneous functions BIOS CMOS (complementary metal -oxide -semiconductor) isthe term usually used todescribe the small amount ofmemory on a computer motherboard that stores the BIOS settings . Acomputer needs asemi -permanent way ofkeeping some start -up data e.g.thecurrent time, theno.ofhard disks the data may need to be updated changed CMOS memory requires (very little) power toretain itscontents . supplied byabattery onthemotherboard .CMOS Memory The CMOS is usually powered by a CR2032 cell battery. Incorrect or slow system date and time and loss of BIOS settings are major signs of a dead or dying CMOS battery.Cont..
