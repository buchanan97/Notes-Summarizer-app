s take in data to be processed, e.g. to calculate the area of rectangle input may be the rectangle height and rectangle width. Step Define the variables : Algorithm's variables allow you to use it for more than one place. We can define two variables for rectangle height and rectangle width as HEIGHT and WIDTH (or H W) . We should use meaningful variable name e.g . instead of using H W use HEIGHT and WIDTH as variable name. Step Outline the algorithm's operations : Use input variable for computation purpose, e.g. to find area of rectangle multiply the HEIGHT and WIDTH variable and store the value in new variable (say) AREA. An algorithm's operations can take the form of multiple steps and even branch, depending on the value of the input variables. Step Output the results of your algorithm's operations : In case of area of rectangle output will be the value stored in variab le AREA. if the input variables described a rectangle with a HEIGHT of and a WIDTH of , the algorithm would output the value of . FLOWCHART: The first design of flowchart goes back to 1945 which was designed by John Von Neumann. Unlike an algorithm, Flowchart uses different symbols to design a solution to a problem. It is another commonly used programming tool. By looking at a Flowchart one can understand the operations and sequence of operations performed in a system. Flowchart is often considered as a blueprint of a design used for solving a specific problem . Advantages of flowchart: Flowchart is an excellent way of communicating the lo gic of a program. Easy and efficient to analyze problem using flowchart. During
