-a Increment i Decrement -- i-- The first assigns positive to a The second assigns the negative value of a to b. i is equivalent to i i i--is equivalent to i i - Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Classification of Operator Continued Binary Operator C Operation Operator Example Addition a b Subtraction - a -b Division a b Multiplication a b Modulus a b The division ofvariables oftype intwill always produce a variable oftype intastheresult . You could only use modulus ( )operation onintvariables . Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Arithmetic operators are further classified as: Integer Arithmetic Real Arithmetic Mixed Mode Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Classification of Operator Continued Relational Operator It is use to compared value of two expressions depending on their relation.
