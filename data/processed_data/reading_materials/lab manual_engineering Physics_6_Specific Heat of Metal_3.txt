on Table Note: Repeat the experiment with any of the single metals for three times to obtain more accurate measurement of specific heat , and then after alter the metal and repeat the same cycle. Calculation . Determine the mass of water in the calorimeter, the mass of metal used, the temperature change of the water, and the temperature change of the metal. Note that the water and the metal each have the same final temperature, but since they started at different temperatures, they have different temperature changes. . Using the specific heat of water as cal g C or J g C, calculate the heat absorbed by the water in ca lories and in joules. (Use Q Cpm T.) . Determine t he amount of heat given off by the metal in calories and in joules. . Use Q Cpm T to determine the heat capacity of the metal. (Make sure to use the heat given off by the metal, the mass of the metal, and the temperature change of the metal in this calcul ation.) Results Percentage error in specific heat of different metals.
