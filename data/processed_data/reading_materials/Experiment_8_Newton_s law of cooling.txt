Apparatus: Newton s law of cooling apparatus, Battery eliminator, Digital stop clock Omega type DSC , Thermometer Pictorial Diagram Newton s Law of Cooling Newton s Law of Cooling Isaac Newton Newton's lawofcooling states thattherateofheat loss ofabody isdirectly proportional tothe difference inthetemperatures between thebody and itssurroundings . Convection cooling issometimes said tobe governed by"Newton's lawofcooling . When theheat transfer coefficient isindependent, orrelatively independent, ofthe temperature difference between object and environment, Newton's lawisfollowed . Newton's lawonly approximates theresult when thetemperature difference isrelatively small .
