[SOURCE: B.Tech CS Materials] CE143: COMPUTER CONCEPTS PROGRAMMING Chapter Operators and Expression in C Devang Patel Institute of Advance Technology and Research Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Objectives To learn arithmetic, string, relational, logical, bit wise, unary, binary, ternary operators To learn about implicit explicit conversions between values ofdifferent types To learn how tobuild complicated expressions from operators and functions Tolearn how operator precedence associativity control order ofevaluation Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Introduction Inthis chapter, wewill discuss Classification of Operators Arithmetic Expression Evaluation Type Conversion :Implicit Explicit Associativity Precedence Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Operators Operator isasymbol that tells the computer toperform certain mathematical orlogical manipulations . Operators are used inprograms tomanipulate the data and variables . They usually form apart ofthe mathematical orlogical expressions . Some operator required 2operands (Binary Operator) to perform operation or Some required single operand (Unary) toperform operation . Chapter : Operators and Expression in C C operators are classified into no. of categories .Arithmetic Operators .Relational Operators .Logical Operators .Assignment Operators .Increment Decrement Operators .Bitwise Operators .Conditional Operators .Special Operators Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Classification of Operator Continued Arithmetic Operator This operator used fornumeric calculation . There are2types ofarithmetic operators in C: .unary operators :operators that require only one operand . .binary operators :operators that require two operands . Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Classification of Operator Continued Unary Operator C Operation Operator Example Positive a Negative - b
