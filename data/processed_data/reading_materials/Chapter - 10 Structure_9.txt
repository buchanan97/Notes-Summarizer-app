: Looping Chapter : Structures It is possible to pass a structure or structures to functions in two ways. . Structures may be passed to functions by passing individual structure members one by one (Call -by-Value) . In this method, structure members are passed by value, therefore, the members of a caller s structure cannot be modified by the called function. . It is also possible to pass the entire structure or by passing a pointer to the structure (Call -by-Reference) . In this method, structure members are passed by reference (like memory address) and the caller's structure can be modified by the function (as like passing an array with reference). Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Structure as function arguments Continue Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Passing structure by value (Call By Value) A structure variable can be passed to the function as an argument as normal variable. If structure is passed by value, change made in structure variable in function definition does not reflect in original structure variable in calling function. Example : include stdio.h struct student char name ; introll; ; void Display( struct student stu); Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Structure as function arguments Continue Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures int main() struct student s1; printf("Enter student's name: "); scanf(" s", s1.name); printf("Enter roll number:"); scanf(" d", s1.roll); Display(s1); passing structure variable s1 as argument return ; void Display(struct student stu) printf("Output n Name: s",stu.name); printf(" n Roll: d",stu.roll); Output Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Structure as function arguments Continue Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Passing structure by reference (Call By Reference) The address location
