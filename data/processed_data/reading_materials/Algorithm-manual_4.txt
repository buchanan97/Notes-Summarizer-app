add the value stored in variable A and variable B then assign store the value in variable C . The statement R R means that add I to the value stored in variable R and then assign store the new value in variable R, in other words increase the value of variable R by Mathematical Operators: Operator Meaning Example Addition A B - Subtraction A B Multiplication A B Division A B Power A for A3 Reminder A B Relational Operators Operator Meaning Example Less than A B Less than or equal to A B or Equal to A B or !
