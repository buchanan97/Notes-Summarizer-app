Waveform of v and i: - Power Waveform: - Active, Reactive and Apparent Power .Apparent Power :- The product ofr.m.svalues ofvoltage and current ina.c. circuit iscalled apparent power . Itisdenoted by S Apparent power VI Itismeasured involt amp (VA) .Active Power :- The power which isactually consumed inana.c.circuit is called active power . OR Itisthepower which isactually dissipated inthecircuit resistance . Itisdenoted by P Active Power Voltage active component ofcurrent V Icos Itismeasured in Watt (W). .Reactive Power :- Power drawn bythecircuit due toreactive component ofcurrent iscalled reactive power . Itisdenoted by Q Reactive power Voltage Reactive component of current V Isin Itismeasured in( ) Apurely inductor and pure capacitor donotconsume any power, means that during ve half cycle they received power and returned tothesource in vehalf cycle .This power which flows back iscalled reactive power . where OA Active power V Icos OB reactive power V Isin OC Apparent power VI10 Examples: .Acoil takes A,when connected across V, Hz main .The power consumed bythecoil isfound tobe W.Calculate resistance and inductance ofcoil. Ans:- .Apower dissipation of1.2k W occurs when a sinusoidal voltage of100volts r.m.s.isapplied toan R-Lseries circuit and acurrent flow isgiven by i sin( t- ).determine :(i)Impedance, resistance and inductance (ii) Power factor ofthe circuit and (iii) Voltage across Rand L.Draw vector diagram showing current and allvoltages . Ans:- .Achoke coil having aresistance of10 and a inductance of63.7m H isconnected inseries with a resistance
