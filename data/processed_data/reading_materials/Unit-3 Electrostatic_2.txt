because electrons aremoved against theopposing forces . This energy isstored inthe electrostatic field setup between the plates ofthe capacitor inthe dielectric medium . Consider acapacitor of Cfarad connected across a source of Vvolts forcharging . During charging work isdone inshifting thecharge from one plate totheother . Let any instant, the charge onthe capacitor isq coulomb and p.d.across itisvvolts . If further charge dq is shifted, then amount of work is given by, Total work done in raising the potential of uncharged capacitor will be42 .Two capacitors having capacitance of20 Fand Fareconnected inseries across a600 Vd.c.supply . Calculate thepotential difference across each capacitor . Ifathird capacitor ofunknown capacitance isnow connected inparallel with the20 Fcapacitor such that thepotential difference across 30 Fcapacitor is400 V, calculate (i)thevalue ofunknown capacitance and (ii) energy stored inthethird capacitor . CHARGING OF CAPACITOR Figure shows acapacitor ofcapacitance Cconnected inseries with anoinductive resistor Rand the combination isconnected toad.c.supply of Vvolts through aswitch S. For charging, theswitch must beclosed .Attheinstant ofclosing the switch, there isnocharge onthe capacitor and therefore nopotential difference across it. Asaresult, the whole ofthe applied voltage must momentarily actacross anon-inductive resistor R. Asaresult, initial value ofcharging current becomes equal to V R which ismaximum possible . The charging current gradually decreases from its maximum value tillitfinally becomes zero when the potential difference across the capacitor plates becomes equal and opposite tothesupply voltage V. After closing theswitch, thecapacitor starts charging and voltage across itincreases gradually . Integrating both the sides RC Discharging of Capacitor53 .
