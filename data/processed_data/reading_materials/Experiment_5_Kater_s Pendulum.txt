Kater s Pendulum Experiment : Kater s Pendulum Objective: To determine the value of g using Kater s Pendulum. Apparatus: Kater s pendulum, Stopwatch and a meter scale. Theory: Animprovement intheprecision ofthemeasurement ofgwasdeveloped in1817 by Kater .Herealized that byusing acompound pendulum and suspending itfrom each endinturn therequirement tomeasure the distance from thecentre ofmass tothepivot could beremoved .Hemade avery accurate measurement ofgin London, avalue that wasused to define themeter formany years .The version of Kater's reversible pendulum used inthisexperiment hasaknife -edge forsuspension at either end:thus there aretwodistances, l1and l2,andtwoperiods T1and T2. Thefollowing formula isused forthedetermination ofacceleration dueto gravity g : 8 2 21 22 1 2 21 22 1 2( ) Here, T1:time periods oftheoscillating pendulum from knife -edge K1 T2:time periods oftheoscillating pendulum from knife -edge K2 l1:distances between knife -edges K1and CGofthependulum l2:distances between knife -edges K2and CGofthependulum When T1and T2areveryclose toeach other (difference lessthan 1percent), theabove expression becomes as: 8 2 21 22 1 2( ) Procedure: .Fixtheweights asshown infigure .i.e. Oneend M K1 m w K2 wother end .Make sure that thedistances from bigmasses toends andbig masses toknife edges should besymmetrical . .Balance thependulum onasharp wedge such that thesmaller weights areatsymmetrical distant from CG.Now mark the position ofitscenter ofgravity andmeasure thedistances ofthe knife -edges K1and K2 CG.This willgiveyouvalue ofl1and l2. .Suspend thependulum with theknife edge K1and setitto oscillate with small amplitude .Note thetimes for15,20and25 oscillations respectively . .Now, suspend thependulum with theknife -edge K2andsetitto oscillate with small amplitude .Note thetimes for15,20and25 oscillations respectively . .Theoscillations should beseen with thehelp ofatelescope for accuracy .
