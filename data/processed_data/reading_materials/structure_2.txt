we have initialized the structure variable. std1 "Pritesh", , Declaring and Initializing Multiple Variable struct student char name ; int roll; float marks; std1 "Pritesh", , ; std2 "Don", , ; we have declared two structure variables in above code. After declaration of variable we have initialized two variable. std1 "Pritesh", , ; std2 "Don", , ; Initializing inside main struct student int mark1; int mark2; int mark3; ; void main() struct student s1 , , ; - - - - -- - - - - -- ; Keyword typedef while using structure Writing struct structure name variable name; to declare a structure variable isn't intuitive as to what it signifies, and takes some considerable amount of development time. So, developers generally use typedef to name the structure as a whole. For examp typedef struct complex int imag; float real; comp; int main() comp comp1, comp2; Here, typedef keyword is used in creating a type comp (which is of type as struct complex ). Then, two structure variables comp1 and comp2 are created by this comp type. Array of structures Like other primitive data types, we can create an array of structures. struct student int x, y; ; void main() struct student arr ; Access array members arr .x ; arr . y ; printf(" d d", arr .x, arr .y); Arrays within Structure struct student char name ; int rollno; stud; void main() printf ("Enter your Roll No : "); scanf (" d", stud.rollno); printf (" n Enter your Name : "); scanf (" s", stud.name); printf (" n Roll No : d n Name : s", stud.rollno, stud.name); Example : include stdio.h struct Employee int Id; char Name
