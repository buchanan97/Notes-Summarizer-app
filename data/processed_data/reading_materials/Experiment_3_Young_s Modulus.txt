Apparatus: Young s modulus set up, Galvanometer, Metal bar, kg hanger Pictorial Diagram Young s modulus Set up Young s Modulus Young s modulus isnamed after Thomas Young, 19thcentury, British scientist . Insolid mechanics, Young s modulus isdefines as the ratio of the longitudinal stress over longitudinal strain, inthe range ofelasticity the Hook s law holds (stress isdirectly proportional to strain) .Itisameasure ofstiffness ofelastic material . Ifawire oflength Land area ofcross -section 'a' be stretched by aforce Fand ifachange (increase) oflength 'l'isproduced, then Thomas Young Strain :Strain isameasure oftheamount ofthedeformation . or When external force isapplied onabody itslength, volume, orshape changes, itis called strain . Stress :Stress istheforce perunitarea causing adeformation . Stress isproportional tostrain with theconstant ofproportionality depending onthe material being deformed andonthenature ofthedeformation . Hooke s law:Forsmall deformation tostress andstrain aredirectly proportional toeach other . Stress Strain Stress( ) Constant x Strain( ) Stress Strain Elastic modulus (Hooke s law) The stiffness ofamaterial :Amaterial having alarge elastic modulus isvery stiffand difficult todeform .Young s Modulus Young s Modulus Thesimplest elastic behaviour tounderstand isthestretching ofabar,rod, orwire when itsends arepulled .Anobject initially hasuniform cross -sectional area Aandlength l0.Then weapply forces ofequal magnitude F butopposite directions attheends (We saythattheobject isintension) .
