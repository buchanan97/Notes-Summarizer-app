Coulomb s laws of Electrostatics Second Law :-Coulomb's law states that themagnitude ofthe electrostatic force between twopoint charges isdirectly proportional totheproduct ofthemagnitudes ofthecharges and inversely proportional tothesquare ofthedistance between them . Electric Field The space orfield inwhich acharge experiences aforce iscalled an electric field orelectrostatic field . Fig (i)shows electric field due toanisolated positively charged sphere .Aunit positive charge placed near itwill experience aforce directed radially away from thesphere . Therefore, thedirection ofelectric field willberadially outward . Forthenegatively charged sphere shows in Fig(ii),theforce acting on theunitpositive charge would bedirected radially towards thesphere . Fig.(iii)shows theelectric field between a positive charge andanegative charge . Fig.(iv)shows theelectric field between twosimilarly charged bodies . Electric Field Strength (E) Electric flux density (D) Relation between D and E Relation between D and E Absolute and Relative Permittivity Dielectric Strength The maximum voltage which aunit thickness ofadielectric can withstand without being punctured bythe spark iscalled its breakdown potential ordielectric strength . Inother word, itistheminimum potential gradient necessary tocause breakdown ofaninsulator . Dielectric strength decreases with increase inthethickness ofthe insulator i.e.doubling thethickness oftheinsulator does notdouble thesafeworking voltage . .Capacitor :-When dielectric material isplaced between thetwo conducting plates, capacitor isformed . .Capacitance :-The property ofacapacitor tostore charge (electricity) iscalled itscapacitance . Itisthecapability ofacapacitor tostore charge onit. Thecharge ontheplates isproportional tothepotential difference applied across it. Q V
