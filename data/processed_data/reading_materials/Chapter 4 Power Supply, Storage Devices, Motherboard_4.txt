optical ) and mechanical technologies. Primary Storage RAM ( Random Access Memory'') . Called RAM'' because anylocation inthememory canbedirectly accessed inthe same amount oftime asanyother location . ROM ( Read Only Memory'') . Iswhat itsays:contains programs and or data burned in''atthetime ofmanufacture . Commonly used tocontain programs to boot up''thecomputer when itisswitched on. PROM ( Programmable Read Only Memory'') . ROM which is blank'' andinto which programs and or data canbewritten, butonly once . EPROM ( Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory'') . PROM which canbeerased, usually byexposure to UVlight through atransparent window above thechip. Secondary Storage Secondary storage forcomputers isnon-volatile (i.e.does notrequire electrical power toretain itscontents . Thebasic types ofsecondary storage are: -magnetic tape -magnetic disk ( hard'' and floppy'') -optical disk (CD-ROM, WORM, MO) . Classification of Secondary Storage Devices Sequential Access Storage Devices Arrival atthedesired storage location may bepreceded bysequencing through other locations . Data canonly beretrieved inthesame sequence inwhich itisstored . Access time varies according tothestorage location oftheinformation being accessed . Suitable forsequential processing applications where most, ifnotall,ofthedata records need tobeprocessed oneafter another . Magnetic tape isatypical example ofsuch astorage device Magnetic Tape Commonly used sequential -access secondary storage device . Physically, thetape medium isaplastic ribbon, which isusually inch or inch and50to2400 ft.long. Plastic ribbon iscoated with amagnetizable recording material such asiron-oxide or chromium dioxide . Data arerecorded onthetape intheform oftiny invisible magnetized andnonmagnetized spots onitscoated surface . There areseveral varieties ofmagnetic tape: "reels of1 "wide tape (2400 'long) Cartridges of1 "tape Cassettes (very similar toaudio cassettes) Digital Audio Tape (DAT) . Continue Advantages Provides archival orbackup storage . They areinexpensive . They canbeused forlarge files orcopying from disk files. They arerobust, reusable,light,compact andeasy tostore onracks .
