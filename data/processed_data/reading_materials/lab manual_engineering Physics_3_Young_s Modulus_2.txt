load m in kg along the X-axis and the corresponding depression lin along the Y-axis. The nature of the graph, known as the load-depression graph, will be a straight line passing through the origin. Draw three load-depression graphs for the three values of L on the same graph paper. Draw a straight line parallel to the Y-axis as far away from the origin as possible. This line will intersect the three load-depression graphs at three points. Measure the co Experiments for B. Tech. 1st Year Physics Laboratory Department of Physics, IIT Roorkee ordinates (m, l) of these three points. Calculate Llm for the three graphs and find the mean value. . Determine Y using the mean value of Llm , the given value of g, and the measured values of b and d. Table Load depression data for length L Distance between the Knife-edges L cm No. of obs.
