ofstructure variable ispassed tofunction while passing itbyreference . Ifstructure ispassed byreference, change made instructure variable infunction definition reflects inoriginal structure variable inthe calling function . Example : include stdio.h struct distance intfeet; float inch; ; void Add( struct distance d1,struct distance d2, struct distance d3); Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Structure as function arguments Continue Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures int main() struct distance dist1, dist2, dist3; printf("First distance n"); printf("Enter feet: "); scanf(" d", dist1.feet); printf("Enter inch: "); scanf(" f", dist1.inch); printf("Second distance n"); printf("Enter feet: "); scanf(" d", dist2.feet); printf("Enter inch: "); scanf(" f", dist2.inch); Add(dist1, dist2, dist3); Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Structure as function arguments Continue Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures printf(" n Sum of distances d '- .1f "",dist3.feet, dist3.inch); return ; void Add(struct distance d1,struct distance d2, struct distance d3) Adding distances d1 and d2 and storing it in d3 d3- feet d1.feet d2.feet; d3- inch d1.inch d2.inch; if (d3 - inch ) if inch is greater or equal to , converting it to feet. d3- inch - ; d3 - feet; Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Declaration and Initialization of variables Continue Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Looping Passing structure by reference is a lot more efficient than passing structures by value. Passing a structure variable to a function is very similar to passing an array to a function. Note Chapter : Structures Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Union Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Unions are quite similar tothe structures in C.Union isalso aderived type asstructure . Union can bedefined insame manner asstructures just
