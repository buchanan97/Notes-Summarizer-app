to solve a part icular problem or algorithm is an ordered set of unambiguous steps that produces a result and terminates in a finite time Algorithm has the following characteristics Input : An algorithm may or may not require input Output: Each algorithm is expected to prod uce at least one result Definiteness : Each instruction must be clear and unambiguous. Finiteness : If the instructions of an algorithm are executed, the algorithm should terminate after finite number of steps The algorithm and flowchart include following three types of control structures. . Sequence : In the sequence structure, statements are placed one after the other and the execution takes place starting from up to down. . Branching (Selection ): In branch control, there is a condition and according to a condition, a decision of either TRUE or FALSE is achieved. In the case of TRUE, one of the two branches is explored; but in the case of FALSE condition, the other alternative is taken. Generally, the IF -THEN is used to represent branch control . . Loop (Repetition): The Loop or Repetition allows a statement (s) to be executed repeatedly b ased on certain loop condition e.g. WHILE, FOR loops. Advantages of algorithm It is a step -wise representation of a solution to a given problem, which makes it easy to understand. An algorithm uses a definite procedure. It is not dependent on any programming language, so it is easy to understand for anyone even without programming knowledge. Every step in an algorithm has its own logical sequence so it is easy to debug. Algorithm Flowchart Manual CIC-UHF HOW TO WRITE ALGORITHMS Step Define your algorithms input : Many algorithm
