Apparatus: Experimental set up, a spirit level, a meter scale, a screw gauge and a vernier calipers. Formula used: lm bdg LY . Where, g acceleration due to gravity m s2 L distance between two knife edges (in meters) m mass of load in kg b breadth of bar in meter d depth of bar in meters l mean depression in bar corresponding to the load in meters. Experimental Set-up: A rectangular bar AB of uniform cross-section and about one metre long is taken. The bar is placed horizontally and symmetrically on two steel knife-edges N and N . The bar edges, in turn are placed on two heavy iron stands provided with leveling screws. At the mid-point of the bar is placed a light frame F containing a vertical pointer P and a scale pan. Weights are placed on the hanger o depress the bar. Theory: For a light bar of breadth b and depth d is placed horizontally on knife-edges separated by a distance L and a load of mass m applied at the mid-point of the bar produces a depression lof the bar. Then young s modulus of the material is given by: lm bdg LY . Here, g is the acceleration due to gravity. Experiments for B.
