we choose our plot so that it will produce a straight line. A straight line is easy to draw, we can quickly determine slope and intercept of a straight line, and we can quickly detect deviations from the straight line. If we have the guidance of a theory we can choose our plot variables accordingly. If we are using data for which we have no theo ry we can empirically try different plots until we arrive at a straight line. Some common functions are listed in Table along with plots which yield straight lines. Table . Different graphs f or different functions. This summarizes some of the most common mathematical relations and the graphing techniques needed to find slopes and intercepts.

These will be discussed in a later section. Straight line graphs on linear graph paper Suppose that we have plotted a graph with Y on the ordinate a nd X on the abscissa and the result is a straight line. We know that the general equation for a straight line is Y M
