n,i, ans) ; getch(); Chapter : Looping Entry Controlled Loop -for loop Comparing forand while Loop Chapter : Looping Entry Controlled Loop -for loop Chapter : Looping A for loop is used when a loop is to be executed a known number of times. We can do the same thing with a while loop, but the for loop is easier to read and more natural for counting loops. Note Additional features of for loop . p ; for(n ;n ; n) . for( p ,n ;n ; n) . for( n ,m ;n m; n n ,m m - ) . for i ; i sum ; i) . for( x (m n ) ; x ; x x ) Multiple initialization Multiple initialization and inc dec Complex conditions Multiple initialization instead of inc dec Chapter : Looping Additional features of for loop . m ; for(;m! ;) printf ( d n ,m ); m m ; . for(j 1000;j ;j j - ) ;Initialization and inc decsection can be omitted. (Initialization can done before the for statement and inc deccan be done inside the body loop) Loop is executed 1000 times without producing any output; it simply causes time delay. Body of the loop contains only a semicolon, known as null statement Chapter : Looping Exit Controlled Loop -do..while loop Chapter : Looping An Exit Control Loop checks the condition for exit and if given condition forexit evaluate totrue, control will exit from the loop body else control will enter again into theloop . Such type ofloop controls exit oftheloop that s why itiscalled exit control loop . Exit Controlled Loop -do while loop Do while loop is an
