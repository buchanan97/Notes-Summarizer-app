of for pointers in C include stdio.h int main() A normal integer variable int Var ; A pointer variable that holds address of var. int ptr Var; This line prints value at address stored in ptr. Value stored is value of variable "var" printf( "Value of Var d n", ptr); The output of this line may be different in different runs even on same machine. printf("Address of Var p n", ptr); We can also use ptr as lvalue (Left hand side of assignment) ptr ; Value at address is now This prints printf("After doing ptr , ptr is d n", ptr); Value of Var Address of Var 0x7fffa057dd4 After doing ptr , ptr is How to Use Pointers? There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer (c) Finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by us ing unary operator that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations void main () int var ; actual variable declaration int ip; pointer variable declaration ip var; store address of var in pointer variable printf("Address of var variable: x n", var ); address stored in pointer variable printf("Address stored in ip variable: x n", ip ); access the value using the pointer printf("Value of ip variable: d n", ip ); Address of var variable: bffd8b3c Address stored in ip variable: bffd8b3c Value of ip variable: C Programming Pointers and Arrays include stdio.h int main() char char
