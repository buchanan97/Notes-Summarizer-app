Magnetic Disk This is the most common form of secondary storage used today. Magnetic disks come in two forms: hard disks floppy disks Hard disks are(usually butnotalways) permanently mounted inside thecomputer . Allmagnetic disks have amagnetizable iron oxide coating andread write heads that canmove over thesurface ofthedisk, which isspinning underneath it.Thedisk head works inasimilar way tothehead inanaudio tape recorder .Theread write head ina floppy disk drive actually contacts themagnetic disk, butthatinahard disk flies'' a fewthousandths ofaninch above it. Hard Disk Round, flatpiece ofrigid metal (frequently aluminum) disks coated with magnetic oxide . Comes inmany sizes, ranging from 1to14-inch diameter . Depending onhow they arepackaged, hard disks areofthree types : Zip Bernoulli disks Disk spaces Winchester disks Primary on-linesecondary storage device formost computer systems today . Floppy Disk Round, flatpiece offlexible plastic disks coated with magnetic oxide . Socalled because they aremade offlexible plastic plates which canbend . They arealsoknown asfloppies ordiskettes . Plastic disk isencased inasquare plastic orvinyl jacket cover that gives handling protection tothedisk surface . Thetwotypes offloppy disks are: 5 -inch diskette, whose diameter is5 -inch.Itisencased ina square, flexible vinyl jacket . 5 -inch diskette, whose diameter is3 -inch.Itisencased ina square,hard plastic
