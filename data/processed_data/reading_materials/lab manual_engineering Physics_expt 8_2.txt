of hot object at time s, k positive constant Procedure . Find the least counts of thermometers T1 and T2. Take some water in a beaker and measure its te mperature (at room temperature C) with one (say T1) of the thermometers. . Examine the working of the stop-watch clock and find its least count. . Pour water into the double - walled container (enclosure) at room temperature. Insert the other thermometer T2 in water contained in it, with the help of the clamp stand. . Heat some water separately to a temperature of about C above the room temperature To. Pour hot water in calorimeter up to its top. . Put the calorimeter, with hot water, back in the enclosure and cover it with the lid having holes. Insert the thermometer T1 and the stirrer in the calorimeter through the holes provided in the lid, as shown in Fig. E14. . . Note the initial temperature of the water between enclosure of double wall with the thermometer T2, when the difference of readings of two thermometers T1 and T2 is about o C. Note the initial re ading of the thermometer T1. . Keep on stirring the water gently and constantly. Note the reading of thermometer T1, first after about every half a minute, then after about one minute and finally after two minutes duration or so. . Keep on simultaneously notin g the reading of the stop -watch and that of the thermometer T1, while stirring water gently and constantly, till the temperature of water in the calorimeter falls to a temperature of about o C above that of the enclosure. Note the temperature of the enclo sure,
