a positive temperature co-efficient of resistance . E.g. Copper, Aluminium Resistance ofalloys increases with the riseintemperature . But theincrease in resistance is irregular andsmall . Alloys have avery low value of positive temperature co-efficient of resistance . E.g.Nichrome Resistance of Insulators, Semi -Conductors Electrolytes decreases with the rise in temperature . As temperature is increased, many free electrons arecreated . Sothere isadrop inthe value oftheresistance . Hence they have a negative temperature coefficient ofresistance . E.g.Rubber, Oil,Plastic20 .Awire has aresistance of2ohms .Ithas been stretched tothelength 3times that oforiginal, what will betheresistance ofwire? Solution :- .Calculate the resistance of100 mlength ofawire having auniform cross section area of0.1mm2ifthe wire ismade of Manganin having aresistivity of 10e-8ohm -m.Ifthewire isdrawn out tothree times itsoriginal length, find outnew resistance . Solution :- . Aresistance wire 10m.long and cross section area 10mm2at0degree Celsius passes, acurrent of10 A,when connected toad.c.supply of200 Volts .Calculate : I. Resistivity of the material II. Current which will flow through the wire when the temp. rises to degree Celsius. Given per degree Celsius. Solution: - . A copper coil has a resistance of ohm at degree Celsius and ohms at degree Celsius, find: - I. Temperature co -efficient of resistance at degree Celsius II. Resistance of coil at degree Celsius III. Temperature co -efficient of resistance at degree Celsius IV. Resistance of coil at degree Celsius Solution: - .A W, V bulb is connected in series with a W, V , bulb across V supply. Calculate (i) Circuit current (ii) V oltage across each lamp assume bulb resistance to remain unchanged. Solution: - V oltage across V bulb: -IR1 V V oltage across V bulb; -IR2 V .Two bulbs rated V, Wand100wrespectively
