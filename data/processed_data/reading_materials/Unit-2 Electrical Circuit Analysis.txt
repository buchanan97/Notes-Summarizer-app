Inother words, whenever twoormore conductors meet atapoint then the sum ofthecurrent flowing towards the junction point isequal tothesum of current flowing away from it. Ifthecurrent entering into ajunction areassigned apositive sign, then the current leaving thejunction will be assigned anegative sign. Kirchhoff's Voltage Law ( KVL) KVL states that thealgebraic sum ofthepotential differences inany loop must beequal tozero as: V . Since the two resistors, R1and R2are wired together inaseries connection, they areboth part ofthe same loop sothe same current must flow through each resistor . Thus the voltage drop across resistor, R1 I R1 and the voltage drop across resistor, R2 I R2 giving by KVL : Definition .Element :-Itisamathematical model oftwoterminal electrical device which canbecompletely characterized byitsvoltage andcurrent . .Network :-The interconnection oftwo ormore elements called anelectric network . .Circuit :-Ifanetwork contains atleast oneclosed path, itiscalled andelectric circuit . .Active element :-The element which iscapable of delivering anaverage power greater than zero to some external device over aninfinite time interval is called anactive element . .Passive element :-The element which iscapable only ofreceiving power iscalled passive element . .Node :-The point atwhich two ormore elements are connected together iscalled asnode . .Junction :-Itisapoint where three ormore elements areconnected together . .Branch :-Asection orportion ofanetwork orcircuit which liesbetween two junction points iscalled as branch . .Loop :-Any closed path
