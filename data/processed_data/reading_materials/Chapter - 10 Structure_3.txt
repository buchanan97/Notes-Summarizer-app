Structures Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Declaration of variables Continue Way : Declare Variables using struct Keyword Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Way :Declaring Multiple Structure Variables Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Declaration of variables Continue Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Different ways to initialize structure variable : Way : Declare and Initialize Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Inthe code snippet, wehave seen that structure isdeclared and assoon as after declaration we have initialized thestructure variable . std1 "Pritesh", , Initialization of variables Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Way : Declaring and Initializing Multiple Variables Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Inthis example, wehave declared two structure variables inabove code .After declaration of variable we have initialized two variable . std1 "Pritesh", , ; std2 "Don", , ; Initialization of variables Continue Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Way : Initializing Single member Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Though there are three members ofstructure, only one isinitialized ,Then remaining two members are initialized with Zero .Ifthere are variables ofother data type then their initial values will be Initialization of variables Continue Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Way : Initializing inside main Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures We need to initialize structure variable to allocate some memory to the structure .Initialization of variables Continue Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Declaration and Initialization of variables Continue Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Looping When we declare a structure then memory won t be allocated for the structure, only writing
