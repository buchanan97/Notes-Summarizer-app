the result from the computer through the output devices such as monitor and printer. Advantages of Computer The main advantages of computer are: . It works very fast. . It is very efficient. Its efficiency never decreases with its age. Limitations of Computer The main limitations of computer are as under: . The computer cannot think itself like human beings. . It cannot find the error (mistakes) in a given data and it cannot correct such mistake s. . It requires the lengthy of instructions to process the simple data. Data measurement in computer Generally, the data and instructions given by the user in the high -level language but the high -level language cannot directly understand by the C P U. Instead of that, all the data and instructions are understood by the computer in Machine Level or Binary language (in the form of s and s). The data and instructions in high -level language that are given by the user to the C P U will be converted into Mac hine Level Language. Later the output that is given by the C P U, which is in the machine level language, is converted into high -level language. The data in computer is measured as under: or Bit (Binary Digit) Bits Nibble Bits Nibbles Byte 1024 Bytes Kilo Byte (KB) ( ) 1024 Kilo Byte Mega Byte (MB) ( ) ( , , Bytes) 1024 Mega Byte Giga Byte (GB) 1024 Giga By te Ter a Byte (TB) 1024 Terra Byte Peta Byte (PB) 1024 Peta Byte Exa Byte (EB) Applications of Comp uter The main applications of computer are as follows: Schools and Colleges: Administration and Management Hospitals: Administration
