by a transverse line on the bar. Draw three pairs of marks L L2, L3 L4, L5 L6 which are equidistant from the central mark and lie on both side of the mark. Choose L L2 cm, L L4 , L L6 60cm. Mount, on the bar, the frame F carrying a knife-edges N1 , N2 such that the L L2 marks coincide with the knife edges. Mount a spirit level on the bar and adjust the leveling screws until the bar is horizontal. . Determine the vernier constant of the meter scale with zero load on the hangar, record the position of the microscope. Place a load of kg on the hangar. This will produce a depression on the bar. Note down the reading of the micrometer. The difference of the two microscopic readings gives the depression of the bar for a load of kg. Increase gradually the load in steps of kg and at each step record the reading of the micrometer. Now decrease the reading one by one and note reading every time. Thus for a given load two readings- one while increasing and other while decreasing, are obtained. Determine the mean of these readings and calculate the depression by subtracting the zero-load reading. . Similarly take the load-depressions for the other pairs of marks, L L4 and L L6 on the bar. . Determine the vernier constant of the slide calipers and measure with it the breadth of the bar at three different places. Calculate the mean breadth b of the bar. . Repeat the above step for measuring the mean depth d of the bar with a screw gauge. . Draw the graph with the
