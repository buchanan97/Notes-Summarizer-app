Auser -defined data type lets you group data ofdifferent types inasingle variable . This data type can contain any kind ofrelated information you want tostore and use together, such as personnel information, company financial information, inventory, and customer and sales records . Avariable ofauser -defined data type holds actual data, notapointer tothat data . Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Structure definition Astructure can beconsidered asatemplate used for defining acollection ofvariables under asingle name . Structures help programmers to group elements of different data types into asingle logical unit (Unlike arrays which permit aprogrammer togroup only elements of same data type) . Structures are commonly used todefine records tobe stored infiles Structures are very powerful concept that programmers use inmany Cprograms .
