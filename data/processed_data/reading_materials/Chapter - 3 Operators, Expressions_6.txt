Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Both operands of the modulo operator ( ) must be integral types.Note Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Classification of Operator Continued Ternary Operator (?:) The conditional operator (?:) is used to simplify an if else statement. Syntax : Condition ? True Expression1 : False Expression2 Example : (n ) ? (a b) : (a b) When (n ) then the result is (a b), otherwise the result is (a b). Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Classification of Operator Continued Short -hand Operator AShorthand operator isashorter way toexpress something that isalready available inthe Cprogramming language . Short -hand Operator : ,- , and . Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Classification of Operator Continued Chapter : Operators and Expression in C The left operand in an assignment expression must be a single variable.Note Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Type Conversion Type Conversion Converting anexpression ofagiven type into another type is known astype -casting . Type conversion occurs when the expression has data ofmixed data types . Example ofsuch expression include converting aninteger value intoafloat value, orassigning the value ofthe expression toa variable with different data type . Intype conversion, the data type ispromoted from lower to higher because converting higher tolower involves loss of precision and value . Chapter : Operators and Expression in C Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Type Conversion Type Conversion For type conversion, Cfollowing some General rules explained below .Integer types arelower than floating point types .Signed types arelower than unsigned types
