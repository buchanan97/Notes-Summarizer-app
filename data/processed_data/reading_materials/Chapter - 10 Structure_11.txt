the keyword used indefining union isunion where keyword used indefining structure was struct . Syntax : union car char name ; intprice; ; Union variables can be created in similar manner as structure variable. union car char name ; intprice; c1, c2, c3; Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Union Continue Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Or Variable can be created inside function union car char name ; int price; ; ------- Inside Function ----------- union car c1, c2, c3; Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Union Continue Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Accessing members of an union : The member of unions can be accessed in similar manner as that structure. Suppose, we you want to access price for union variable c1 in above example, it can be accessed as c1.price . If you want to access price for union pointer variable c3, it can be accessed as ( c3).price or as c3- price . Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Union Continue Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Difference between union and structure . There is difference in memory allocation between union and structure . The amount of memory required to store a structure variables is the sum of memory size of all members. But, the memory required to store a union variable is the memory required for largest element of an union. Chapter : Constants, Variables Data Types in C Union Continue Chapter : Looping Chapter : Structures Difference between union and structure . All members of structure can be accessed at any time. But, only one member of union can be accessed at a time in case of
