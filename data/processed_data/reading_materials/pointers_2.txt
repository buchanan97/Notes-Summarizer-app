is just a similar notation that creates a pointer. Example To Demonstrate Working of Pointers include stdio.h int main() int pc; int c; c ; printf("Address of c: u n", c); printf("Value of c: d n n", c); pc c; printf("Address of pointer pc: u n", pc); printf("Content of pointer pc: d n n", pc); c ; printf("Address of pointer pc: u n", pc); printf("Content of pointer pc: d n n", pc); pc ; printf("Address of c: u n", c); printf("Value of c: d n n", c); return ; O P:- Address of c: 2686784 Value of c: Address of pointer pc: 2686784 Content of pointer pc: Address of pointer pc: 2686784 Content of pointer pc: Address of c: 2686784 Value of c: Initialization of Pointer variable Pointer Initialization is the process of assigning address of a variable to a pointer variable. Pointer variable can only contain address of a variable of the same data type. In C language address operator is used to determine the address of a variable. The (immediately preceding a variable name) returns the address of the variable associated with it. include stdio.h void main() int a ; int ptr; pointer declaration ptr a; pointer initialization Pointer variable always point to variables of same datatype. include stdio.h void main() float a; int ptr; ptr a; ERROR, type mismatch If you are not sure about which variable's address to assign to a pointer variable while declaration, it is recommended to assign a NULL value to your pointer variable. A pointer which is assigned a NULLvalue is called a NULL pointer. include stdio.h int main() int ptr NULL; return ; KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER ABOUT POINTERS IN C:
