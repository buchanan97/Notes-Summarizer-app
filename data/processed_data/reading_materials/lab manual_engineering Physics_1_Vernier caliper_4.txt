experimenter may measure incorrectly, or may use poor technique in taking a measurement, or may intr oduce a bias into measurements by expecting (and inadvertently forcing) the results to agree with the expected outcome. Uncertainties and graph : Graphs are a means of summarizing data so that the results may be easily understood. Working graphs are done on fine grid graph paper so that data may be easily read from the graph. New data may be extracted from the graph that would be hard to otherwise obtain. Use of graphs in experimental physics: In practical physics, the graph of the experimental data is most important in improving the understanding of the experimental results. Moreover from the graphs one can calculate unknowns related to the experiments and one can compare the experimental data with the theoretical curve when they are presented on same graph. There are different types of graph papers available in market. So, one should choose the appropriate type of graph paper to present their experimental results in the best way depending upon the values of the experimental data and the theoretical expressio n of the functions. To understand all those some of the assignments are given below in addition to those we discussed before. Basic layout of a graph (a) The horizontal axis is called the abscissa and the vertical axis is called the ordinate. You can use the terms horizontal and vertical just as well. (b) The graph must have a title which clearly states the purpose of the graph. This should be located on a clear space near the top of the graph. The title should uniquely identify the graph --you should no t have three
