Same as CD-ROM andhassame storage capacity . Allows user tocreate their own CD-ROM disks byusing a CD-recordable (CD-R) drive thatcanbeattached toacomputer asaregular peripheral device . Data toberecorded canbewritten onitssurface inmultiple recording sessions . Information recorded onthem canberead byanyordinary CD-ROM drive . They areused fordata archiving andformaking apermanent record ofdata. Continue CD-Read Write (CD-RW) Same as CD-Randhassame storage capacity . Allows user tocreate their own CD-ROM disks byusing a CD-recordable (CD-R) drive thatcanbeattached toacomputer asaregular peripheral device . Data toberecorded canbewritten onitssurface inmultiple recording sessions . Made ofmetallic alloy layer whose chemical properties arechanged during burn and erase . Canbeerased andwritten afresh . Digital Video Versatile Disk (DVD) Looks same as CD-ROM buthascapacity of4. GBor8. GB. Designed primarily tostore anddistribute movies . Canbeused forstorage oflarge data. Allows storage ofvideo in4:3or16:9aspect -ratios in MPEG -2video format using NTSC or PAL resolution . Continue Advantages Thecost-per-bitofstorage foroptical disks isvery lowbecause oftheir lowcost and enormous storage density . The useofsingle spiral track makes optical disks anideal storage medium for reading large blocks ofsequential data, such asmusic . Optical disks have adata storage lifeinexcess of30years .This makes them abetter storage medium fordata archiving ascompared tothemagnetic tapes ormagnetic disks . Due totheir compact size andlight weight, optical disks areeasy tohandle, store, andportfrom oneplace toanother . Disadvantages Itislargely read-only storage medium .Data once recorded, cannot beerased and hence theoptical disks cannot bereused . Thedata access speed foroptical disks isslower than magnetic disks . Optical disks require acomplicated drive mechanism .
