the arithmetical and logical calculations in a computer. Control Unit This unit is responsible for all the operations held in a computer. It controls both the flow of input as well as output in a computer and it controls all the operations taking place in a computer. It works like traffic police and it is called as the nervous system of computer. Output Unit Output units are the devices, from which the use r gets the result in a computer. Ex: Monitor (V D U), Printer, Speaker , Plotter . BLOCK DIAGRAM OF COMPUTER CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT Contol Signal Flow of data Usually the input given by the user will flow and store into Memory unit (RAM), then the given input will be checked by Control Unit then it transfers the input to the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU processes such data according to the instructions given by the user and it again resends the out put (result) to the Memory Unit (RAM). Then the output will be taken by the user the user through output devices such as Monitor and Printer. C P U INPUT UNIT OUTPUT UNIT CONTROL UNIT MEMORY UNIT (RAM) A L U Memory Memory is a storage device. It stores both the input as well as output in a computer . In memory, there a re mainly two types. They are: . Primary Memory or Main Memory or Internal Memory . Secondary Memory or Auxiliary Memory or External Memory Differences between Main Memory and Secondary Memory Main Memory Secondary Memory . It works very fast it is comparativel y slow . It is costly it is cheap . Storage capacity is less storage capacity
