phase power . Hence, .A415 V, -phase voltage isapplied toabalanced star-connected -phase load of phase impedance ( j4)ohms each.Calculate (i)linecurrent and(ii)total power supplied ink W. Solution :-starconnection .A balanced mesh -connected load of j8 ohms per phase is connected to a - phase, V supply. Find the line current, p.fand power. Solution: -Connection Delta .Three similar coils each ofresistance 15ohms andinductance of0. Hare connected (i)instarand(ii)indelta toa3-phase, V, Hzsupply .Calculate lineandphase values ofcurrent andvoltage inboth thecases .Also calculate the power absorbed . Solution :- ,
