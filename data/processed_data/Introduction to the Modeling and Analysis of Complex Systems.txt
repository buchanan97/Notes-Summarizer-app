Published by Open SUNY Textbooks, Milne Library State University of New Y ork at Geneseo Geneseo, NY 14454 iii About the Textbook Introduction to the Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems introduces students to mathematical/computational modeling and analysis developed in the emerging interdisciplinary ﬁeld of Complex Systems Science . Complex systems are systems made of a large number of microscopic components interacting with each other in nontrivial ways. Many real-world systems can be understood as complex systems, where critically important information resides in the relationships between the parts and not necessarily within the parts themselves. This textbook offers an accessible yet technically-oriented introduction to the modeling and analysis of complex systems. The topics covered include: fundamentals of modeling, basics of dynamical systems, discrete-time models, continuous-time models, bifurcations, chaos, cellular automata, continuous ﬁeld models, static networks, dynamic networks, and agent-based models. Most of these topics are discussed in two chapters, one focusing on computational modeling and the other on mathematical analysis. This unique approach provides a comprehensive view of related concepts and techniques, and allows readers and instructors to ﬂexibly choose relevant materials based on their objectives and needs. Python sample codes are provided for each modeling example.

Knowledge of basic mathematics is presumed of the reader who is given glimpses into the vast, diverse and rich world of nonlinear algebraic and differential equations that model various real-world phenomena. The treatment of the ﬁeld is thorough and comprehensive, and the book is written in a very lucid and student-oriented fashion. A distinguishing feature of the book, which uses the freely available software Python, is numerous examples and hands-on exercises on complex system modeling, with the student being encouraged to develop and test his or her own code in order to gain vital experience. The book is divided into three parts. Part I provides a basic introduction to the art and science of model building and gives a brief historical overview of complex system modeling. Part II is concerned with systems having a small number of variables. After introducing the reader to the important concept of phase space of a dynamical system, it covers the modeling and analysis of both discrete- and continuous-time systems in a systematic fashion. A very interesting feature of this part is the analysis of the behavior of such a system around its equilibrium state, small perturbations around which can lead to bifurcations and chaos. Part III covers the simulation of systems with a large number of variables. After introducing the reader to the interactive simulation tool PyCX, it presents the modeling and analysis of complex systems (e.g., waves in excitable media, spread of epidemics and forest ﬁres) with cellular automata. It next discusses the modeling and analysis of continuous ﬁelds that are represented by partial differential equations. Examples are diffusion-reaction systems which can exhibit spontaneous self-organizing behavior (e.g., Turing pattern formation, Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction and Gray-Scott pattern formation). Part III concludes with the modeling and analysis of dynamical networks and agent-based models. The concepts of emergence and self-organization constitute the underlying thread that weaves the various chapters of the book together. About the Reviewer: Dr. Siddharth G. Chatterjee received his Bachelor’s Degree in Technology (Honors) from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New Y ork, USA, all in Chemical Engineering. He has taught a variety of engineering and mathematical courses and his research interests are the areas of philosophy of science, mathematical modeling and simulation. Presently he is Associate Professor in the Department of Paper and Bioprocess Engineering at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Syracuse, v New Y ork. He is also a Fellow of the Institution of Engineers (India) and Member of the Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers. Sayama has produced a very comprehensive introduction and overview of complexity. Typically, these topics would occur in many different courses, as a side note or possible behavior of a particular type of mathematical model, but only after overcoming a huge hurdle of technical detail. Thus, initially, I saw this book as a “mile-wide, inch-deep” approach to teaching dynamical systems, cellular automata, networks, and the like. Then I realized that while students will learn a great deal about these topics, the real focus is learning about complexity and its hallmarks through particular mathematical models in which it occurs. In that respect, the book is remarkably deep and excellent at illustrating how complexity occurs in so many different contexts that it is worth studying in its own right. In other words, Sayama sort of rotates the axes from “calculus”, “linear algebra”, and so forth, so that the axes are “self-organization”, “emergence”, etc. This means that I would be equally happy to use the modeling chapters in a 100-level introduction to modeling course or to use the analysis chapters in an upper-level, calculus-based modeling course. The Python programming used throughout provides a nice introduction to simulation and gives readers an excellent sandbox in which to explore the topic. The exercises provide an excellent starting point to help readers ask and answer interesting questions about the models and about the underlying situations being modeled. The logical structure of the material takes maximum advantage of early material to support analysis and understanding of more difﬁcult models. The organization also means that students experiencing such material early in their academic careers will naturally have a framework for later studies that delve more deeply into the analysis and application of particular mathematical tools, like PDEs or networks. About the Reviewer: Dr. Kris Green earned his Ph.D. in applied mathematics from the University of Arizona. Since then, he has earned the rank of full professor at St. John Fisher College where he often teaches differential equations, mathematical modeling, multivariable calculus and numerical analysis, as well as a variety of other courses. He has guided a number of successful undergraduate research projects related to modeling of complex systems, and is currently interested in applications of such models to education, both in terms of teaching and learning and of the educational system as a whole. Outside of the ofﬁce, he can often be found training in various martial arts or enjoying life with his wife and two cats. To Mari Preface This is an introductory textbook about the concepts and techniques of mathematical/computational modeling and analysis developed in the emerging interdisciplinary ﬁeld of complex systems science. Complex systems can be informally deﬁned as networks of many interacting components that may arise and evolve through self-organization. Many realworld systems can be modeled and understood as complex systems, such as political organizations, human cultures/languages, national and international economies, stock markets, the Internet, social networks, the global climate, food webs, brains, physiological systems, and even gene regulatory networks within a single cell; essentially, they are everywhere. In all of these systems, a massive amount of microscopic components are interacting with each other in nontrivial ways, where important information resides in the relationships between the parts and not necessarily within the parts themselves. It is therefore imperative to model and analyze how such interactions form and operate in order to understand what will emerge at a macroscopic scale in the system. Complex systems science has gained an increasing amount of attention from both inside and outside of academia over the last few decades. There are many excellent books already published, which can introduce you to the big ideas and key take-home messages about complex systems. In the meantime, one persistent challenge I have been having in teaching complex systems over the last several years is the apparent lack of accessible, easy-to-follow, introductory-level technical textbooks. What I mean by technical textbooks are the ones that get down to the “wet and dirty” details of how to build mathematical or computational models of complex systems and how to simulate and analyze them. Other books that go into such levels of detail are typically written for advanced students who are already doing some kind of research in physics, mathematics, or computer science. What I needed, instead, was a technical textbook that would be more appropriate for a broader audience—college freshmen and sophomores in any science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas, undergraduate/graduate students in other majors, such as the social sciences, management/organizational sciences, health sciences and the humanities, and even advanced high school students looking for research projects who are ix x interested in complex systems modeling. This OpenSUNY textbook is my humble attempt to meet this need. As someone who didn’t major in either physics or mathematics, and who moved away from the mainstream of computer science, I thought I could be a good “translator” of technical material for laypeople who don’t major in those quantitative ﬁelds. To make the material as tangible as possible, I included a lot of step-by-step instructions on how to develop models (especially computer simulation codes), as well as many visuals, in this book. Those detailed instructions/visuals may sometimes look a bit redundant, but hopefully they will make the technical material more accessible to many of you. I also hope that this book can serve as a good introduction and reference for graduate students and researchers who are new to the ﬁeld of complex systems. In this textbook, we will use Python for computational modeling and simulation. Python is a rapidly growing computer programming language widely used for scientiﬁc computing and also for system development in the information technology industries. It is freely available and quite easy to learn for non-computer science majors. I hope that using Python as a modeling and simulation tool will help you gain some real marketable skills, and it will thus be much more beneﬁcial than using other pre-made modeling/simulation software. All the Python sample codes for modeling examples are available from the textbook’s website at http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/ ~sayama/textbook/ , which are directly linked from each code example shown in this textbook (if you are reading this electronically). Solutions for the exercises are also available from this website. To maintain a good balance between accessibility and technical depth/rigor, I have written most of the topics in two chapters, one focusing on hands-on modeling work and the other focusing on more advanced mathematical analysis. Here is a more speciﬁc breakdown: Preliminary chapters 1, 2 Modeling chapters 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19 Analysis chapters 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 17, 18 The preliminary and modeling chapters are marked with an orange side bar at the top, while the analysis chapters are marked with a blue side bar at the bottom. The modeling chapters won’t require any in-depth mathematical skills; some basic knowledge of derivatives and probabilities is enough. The analysis chapters are based on a more solid understanding of calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and probability and statistics. I hope this unique way of organizing topics in two complementary chapters will provide xi a comprehensive view of the related concepts and techniques, as well as allow you to ﬂexibly choose relevant materials based on your learning/teaching objectives and needs. If you are an instructor, here are some suggested uses for this textbook: One-semester course as an introduction to complex systems modeling –Target audience: College freshmen or sophomores (or also for research projects by advanced high school students) –Chapters to be covered: Part I and some modeling chapters selected from Parts II & III One-semester course as an introduction to dynamical systems –Target audience: Senior undergraduate or graduate students –Chapters to be covered: Parts I & II, plus Continuous Field Models chapters (both modeling and analysis) One-semester advanced course on complex systems modeling and analysis –Target audience: Graduate students who already know dynamical systems –Chapters to be covered: Part III (both modeling and analysis) Two-semester course sequence on both modeling and analysis of complex systems –Target audience: Senior undergraduate or graduate students –Chapters to be covered: Whole textbook Note that the chapters of this textbook are organized purely based on their content. They arenotdesigned to be convenient curricular modules that can be learned or taught in similar amounts of time. Some chapters (especially the preliminary ones) are very short and easy, while others (especially the analysis ones) are extensive and challenging. If you are teaching a course using this book, it is recommended to allocate time and resources to each chapter according to its length and difﬁculty level. One more thing I need to note is that the contents of this book are focused on dynamical models, and as such, they are not intended to cover all aspects of complex systems science. There are many important topics that are not included in the text because of the limitation of space and time. For example, topics that involve probability, stochasticity, and statistics, such as information theory, entropy, complexity measurement, stochastic models, statistical analysis, and machine learning, are not discussed much in this book. Fortunately, there are several excellent textbooks on these topics already available. xii This textbook was made possible, thanks to the help and support of a number of people. I would like to ﬁrst express my sincere gratitude to Ken McLeod, the former Chair of the Department of Bioengineering at Binghamton University, who encouraged me to write this textbook. The initial brainstorming discussions I had with him helped me tremendously in shaping the basic topics and structure of this book. After all, it was Ken who hired me at Binghamton, so I owe him a lot anyway. Thank you Ken. My thanks also go to Y aneer Bar-Y am, the President of the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI), where I did my postdoctoral studies (alas, way more than a decade ago—time ﬂies). I was professionally introduced to the vast ﬁeld of complex systems by him, and the various research projects I worked on under his guidance helped me learn many of the materials discussed in this book. He also gave me the opportunity to teach complex systems modeling at the NECSI Summer/Winter Schools. This ongoing teaching experience has helped me a lot in the development of the instructional materials included in this textbook. I would also like to thank my former PhD advisor, Y oshio Oyanagi, former Professor at the University of Tokyo. His ways of valuing both scientiﬁc rigor and intellectual freedom and creativity inﬂuenced me greatly, which are still ﬂowing in my blood. This textbook uses PyCX, a simple Python-based complex systems simulation framework. Its GUI was developed by Chun Wong, a former undergraduate student at Binghamton University and now an MBA student at the University of Maryland, and Przemysław Szufel and Bogumił Kami ´nski, professors at the Warsaw School of Economics, to whom I owe greatly. If you ﬁnd PyCX’s GUI useful, you should be grateful to them, not me. Please send them a thank you note. I thank Cyril Oberlander, Kate Pitcher, Allison Brown, and all others who have made this wonderful OpenSUNY textbook program possible. Having this book with open access to everyone in the world is one of the main reasons why I decided to write it in the ﬁrst place. Moreover, I greatly appreciate the two external reviewers, Kris Green, at St. John Fisher College, and Siddharth G. Chatterjee, at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, whose detailed feedback was essential in improving the quality and accuracy of the contents of this book. In particular, Kris Green’s very thorough, constructive, extremely helpful comments have helped bring the scientiﬁc contents of this textbook up to a whole new level. I truly appreciate his valuable feedback. I also thank Sharon Ryan for her very careful copy editing for the ﬁnal version of the manuscript, which greatly improved the quality of the text. My thanks are also due to my fellow faculty members and graduate students at the Center for Collective Dynamics of Complex Systems (CoCo) at Binghamton University, including Shelley Dionne, Fran Y ammarino, Andreas Pape, Ken Kurtz, Dave Schaffer, Yu xiii Chen, Hal Lewis, Vlad Miskovic, Chun-An Chou, Brandon Gibb, Genki Ichinose, David Sloan Wilson, Prahalad Rao, Jeff Schmidt, Benjamin James Bush, Xinpei Ma, and Hyobin Kim, as well as other fantastic collaborators I was lucky enough to have outside the campus, including Thilo Gross, Ren ´e Doursat, L ´aszl´o Barab ´asi, Roberta Sinatra, Junichi Y amanoi, Stephen Uzzo, Catherine Cramer, Lori Sheetz, Mason Porter, Paul Trunﬁo, Gene Stanley, Carol Reynolds, Alan Troidl, Hugues Bersini, J. Scott Turner, Lindsay Y azzolino, and many others. Collaboration with these wonderful people has given me lots of insight and energy to work on various complex systems research and education projects. I would also like to thank the people who gave me valuable feedback on the draft versions of this book, including Barry Goldman, Blake Stacey, Ernesto Costa, Ricardo Alvira, Joe Norman, Navdep Kaur, Dene Farrell, Aming Li, Daniel Goldstein, Stephanie Smith, Hoang Peter Ta, Nygos Fantastico, Michael Chambers, and Tarun Bist. Needless to say, I am solely responsible for all typos, errors, or mistakes remaining in this textbook. I would greatly appreciate any feedback from any of you. My ﬁnal thanks go to a non-living object, my Lenovo Y oga 13 laptop, on which I was able to write the whole textbook anytime, anywhere. It endured the owner’s careless handling (which caused its touchscreen to crack) and yet worked pretty well to the end. I hope you enjoy this OpenSUNY textbook and begin an exciting journey into complex systems.
