variables Thread A 1x 2print x Thread B 1x What value of xgets printed? What is the nal value of xwhen all these statements have executed? It depends on the order in which th e statements are executed, called the execution path . One possible path is a1 a2 b1, in which case the output of the program is , but the nal value is . Puzzle: What path yields output 5and nal value ? Puzzle: What path yields output 7and nal value ? Puzzle: Is there a path that yields output 7and nal value ? Can you prove it? Answering questions like these is an important part of concu rrent programming: What paths are possible and what are the possible e ect s? Can we prove that a given (desirable) e ect is necessary or that an (undes irable) e ect is impossible? Concurrent updates An update is an operation that reads the value of a variable, c omputes a new value based on the old value, and writes the new value. The mos t common kind of update is an increment, in which the new value is the old val ue plus one. The following example shows a shared variable, count, being updated concurrently by two threads. Thread A 1count count Thread B 1count count At rst glance, it is not obvious that there is a synchronizat ion problem here. There are only two execution paths, and they yield the same re sult. The problem is that these operations are translated into mac hine language before execution, and in machine language the update takes t wo steps, a read and a write. The problem is more obvious if
