values. Next, the variables x and y are multiplied together, divided by their sum, and assigned to z. As C is free-flow, an equivalent (but ugly) version is: Our first program void main(void) float x ;float y ;float z;z x y (x y); Figure , alternate format (to be avoided) This is the complete opposite of Python which has very rigid spacing and formatting rules. Now, suppose that this add, multiply, divide operation is something that you need to do a lot. We could split this off into a separate function. Our program now looks like Figure on the following page: C also allows to denote a single line comment without the backend pairing . Embedded Controllers Our second program float add mult div( float a, float b ) float answer; answer a b (a b); return( answer ); void main( void ) float x ; float y ; float z; z add mult div( x, y ); Figure , program with separate function The new math function takes two floats as arguments and returns a float to the caller. The compiler sees the new function before it is used in main(), thus, it already knows that it should be sent two floats and that the return value must be assigned to a float. It is very important to note that the new math function uses different variable names ( a and b) from the caller (x and y). The variables in the new math function are really just place-holders. The values from the original call ( x and y) are copied to these new variables (a and b) and used within the new function. As they are copies, they
