of Trapezoid Consider the formula for calculating the area of a trapezoid: If we were to code the formula as a b h the area would be calculated incorrectly due to division and multiplication having higher priority than addition. To force the correct evaluation we can use a sub -expression and override operator priorities: the formula must be written as: (a b) h Sub-expressions are used to change the order of evaluation in this case we make a b a sub -expression, and hence evaluated before the division and multiplication. Operator Associativity When an expression involves more than one operator of the same priority it is necessary to understand the order in which they are evaluated. If more than one multiplication or divisio n appears in an expression, they are evaluated from left to right; similarly for addition and subtraction. In programming terms we say these operators are left associative . Suppose if we want to convert a temperature in Celsius to an equivalent Fahrenheit temperature using the formula A programmer can code this as c . This would be correct as the expression is evaluated by Java as required: the division, , is performed, then the multiplication, and then the addition. If divisio n and multiplication were right -to-left associative the result of the above would be incorrect. Mixed Mode Expressions Expressions could contain a mixture of types. Java permits conversions between integer and floating -point types. There are two types of c onversions: widening and narrowing . By widening we mean that the type being converted to contains all values of the other type. For example, any value of the short type (a -byte integer) can be represented
