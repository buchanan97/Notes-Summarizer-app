and arrange those into a line; this is also a sort of permutation. DEFINITION . A permutation ofndistinct objects is an arrangement of those objects into an ordered line. If r n(andris a natural number) then an r-permutation ofn objects is an arrangement of rof thenobjects into an ordered line. . Permutations, Combinations, and the Binomial Theorem So a permutation involves choosing items from a finite population in which every item is uniquely identified, and keeping track of the order in which the items were chosen. Since we are studying enumeration, it shouldn t surprise you that what we ll be asking in this situation is how many permutations there are, in a variety of circumstances. Let s begin with an example in which we ll calculate the number of -permutations of ten objects (or in this case, people). EXAMPLE . Ten athletes are competing for Olympic medals in women s speed skating (1000metres). In how many ways might the medals end up being awarded? SOLUTION. There are three medals: gold, silver, and bronze, so this question amounts to finding the number of -permutations of the ten athletes (the first person in the -permutation is the one who gets the gold medal, the second gets the silver, and the third gets the bronze). To solve this question, we ll apply the product rule, where the aspects that can vary are the winners of the gold, silver, and bronze medals. We begin by considering how many different athletes might get the gold medal. The answer is that any of the ten athletes might get that medal. No matter which of the athletes gets the gold medal, once that is decided we
