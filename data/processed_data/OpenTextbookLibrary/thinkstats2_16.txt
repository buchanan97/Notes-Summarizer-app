df.birthwgt lb.replace(na vals, np.nan) df birthwgt oz df.birthwgt oz.replace(na vals, np.nan) df totalwgt lb df.birthwgt lb df.birthwgt oz agepreg contains the mother's age at the end of the pregnancy. In the data le,agepreg is encoded as an integer number of centiyears. So the rst line divides each element of agepreg by , yielding a oating-point value in years. birthwgt lb andbirthwgt oz contain the weight of the baby, in pounds and ounces, for pregnancies that end in live birth. In addition it uses several special codes: NOT ASCERTAINED REFUSED DON T KNOW Special values encoded as numbers are dangerous because if they are not handled properly, they can generate bogus results, like a -pound baby. Thereplace method replaces these values with np.nan , a special oatingpoint value that represents not a number." As part of the IEEE oating-point standard, all mathematical operations returnnanif either argument is nan: import numpy as np np.nan nan So computations with nantend to do the right thing, and most pandas functions handle nanappropriately. But dealing with missing data will be a recurring issue. The last line of Clean Fem Preg creates a new column totalwgt lb that combines pounds and ounces into a single quantity, in pounds. Chapter . Exploratory data analysis One important note: when you add a new column to a Data Frame, you must use dictionary syntax, like this CORRECT df totalwgt lb df.birthwgt lb df.birthwgt oz Not dot notation, like this: WRONG! df.totalwgt lb df.birthwgt lb df.birthwgt oz The version with dot notation adds an attribute to the Data Frame object, but that attribute is not treated as a new column.
