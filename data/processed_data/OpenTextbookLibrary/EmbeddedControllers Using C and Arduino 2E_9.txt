for details on numeric data types). Arrays are of special interest as they must be contiguous in memory. For example, suppose a system has 1000 bytes of memory and a element char array was declared. If this array starts at address then all of the slots from through are allocated for the array. It cannot be created in scattered fashion with a few bytes here and a few bytes there. This requirement is due to the manner in which arrays are indexed (accessed), as we shall see later. Stacks Many programs need only temporary storage for certain variables. That is, a variable may only be used for a limited time and then thrown away . It would be inefficient to allocate permanent space for this sort of variable. In its place, many systems use a stack. Ordinarily, an application is split into two parts, a code section and a data section. The data section contains the permanent (global) data. As these two will not consume the entire memory map, the remainder of the memory is often used for temporary storage via a stack. The stack starts at the opposite end of the memory map and grows toward the code and data sections. It is called a First-In-Last-Out stack or FILO stack. It works like a stack of trays in a cafeteria. The first tray placed on the stack will be the last one pulled off and vice versa. When temporary Embedded Controllers variables are needed, this memory area is used. As more items are needed, more memory is taken up. As our code exits from a function, the temporary ( auto) variables declared there are no longer needed, and the
