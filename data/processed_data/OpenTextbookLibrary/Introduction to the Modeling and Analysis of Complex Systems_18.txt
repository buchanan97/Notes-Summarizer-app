inputs and outputs can be the current and next states of the system, and if their relationship is not linear, the system is called a nonlinear system . . TOPICAL CLUSTERS The possibility of chaotic behavior in such nonlinear systems implies that there will be no analytical solutions generally available for them. This constitutes one of the several origins of the idea of complexity. Systems theory is another important root of complex systems science. It rapidly developed during and after World War II, when there was a huge demand for mathematical theories to formulate systems that could perform computation, control, and or communication. This category includes several ground-breaking accomplishments in the last century, such as Alan Turing s foundational work on theoretical computer science , Norbert Wiener s cybernetics , and Claude Shannon s information and communication theories . A common feature shared by those theories is that they all originated from some engineering discipline, where engineers were facing real-world complex problems and had to come up with tools to meet societal demands. Many innovative ideas of systems thinking were invented in this eld, which still form the key components of today s complex systems science. Game theory also has an interesting societal background. It is a mathematical theory, established by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern , which formulates the decisions and behaviors of people playing games with each other. It was developed during the Cold War, when there was a need to seek a balance between the two mega powers that dominated the world at that time. The rationality of the game players was typically assumed in many game theory models, which made it possible to formulate the
