It is better for students to read pages than not read pages. Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize jargon and de ne each term at rst use. Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most dif cult topics and split them into a series of small steps. Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest. I needed a title, so on a whim I chose How to Think Like a Computer Scientist . My rst version was rough, but it worked.

The result is this book, now with the less grandiose title Think
