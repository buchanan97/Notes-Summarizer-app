without having studied enumeration or probability, but it nonetheless illustrates the basic principle behind many calculations of probability. The object of enumeration is to enable us to count outcomes in much more complicated situations. This sometimes has natural applications to questions of probability, but our focus will be on the counting, not on the probability. After studying enumeration in this course, you should be able to solve problems such as: If you are playing Texas Hold em poker against a single opponent, and the two cards in your hand are a pair, what is the probability that your opponent has a higher pair? How many distinct Shidokus ( -by- Sudokus) are there? How many different orders of five items can be made from a bakery that makes three kinds of cookies? Male honeybees come from a queen bee s unfertilised eggs, so have only one parent (a female). Female honeybees have two parents (one male, one female). Assuming all ancestors were distinct, how many ancestors does a male honeybee have from generations ago? Although all of these questions (and many others that arise naturally) may be of interest to you, the reason we begin our study with enumeration is because we ll be able to use many of the techniques we learn, to count the other structures we ll be studying. . Graph Theory When a mathematician talks about graph theory, they are not referring to the graphs that you learn about in school, that can be produced by a spreadsheet or a graphing calculator. The graphs that are studied in graph theory are models of networks. Any network can be modeled by using dots to represent the nodes of
