move three legs at a time while the three other legs maintain a stable pose. . Degrees of freedom Figure . From left to right: statically stable robot; dynamically stable inverted pendulum robot; static and dynamically stable robot (depending on configuration). . Degrees of freedom The concept of degree of freedom , often abbreviated as Do F, is important for defining the possible positions and orientations a robot can reach. An object in the physical world can have up to six Cartesian degrees of freedom, namely forward backward, sideways, and up down as well as rotations around those axes. These rotations are known as pitch, yaw, and roll and are illustrated in Figure . These Cartesian degrees of freedom are distinct from the robot s mechanical degrees of freedom, which correspond to the number of points of actuation for a robot (i.e., a robotic arm with five joint motors is referred to as having five mechanical degrees of freedom in joint space , see Chapter ). As a rule of thumb, the number of mechanical Do Fs available to the user depends on the robot platform and cannot easily be changed by the user unless mechanical modifications to the robot are made; conversely, the number of Cartesian Do Fs depends on the task, can be modified by the user, and varies according to what the robot needs to do. After specifying the mechanical and Cartesian Do Fs for your kinematic problem, the number of Cartesian Do Fs (i.e. directions) a robot can actually move in depends on the configuration of its actuators and the constraints the robot has with the environment. These relationships are not always intuitive and require more
