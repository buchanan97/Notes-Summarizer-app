) ; then j will have the value and q will have the value . That statement above would be an odd statement to see in a program. What is more likely is to have several variables all initialized to the same value, as in: int i j k ; The String Class It is very common for a program to work with text strings and the Java String class is provided to facilitate the many things that programmers need to do with text strings. String literals are written as a sequence of characters that are delimited by double quotes. For example: "this is a line of text" "my first name is Joe" "Joe was born on May , 1999" The assignment statement: String full Name "Joe Smith" ; declares full Name to be of type String . full Name is a variable and the Java compiler allocates memory for full Name . The memory location for full Name will contain a reference (an address) to the storage location where the text string Joe Smit h is actually stored. Memory for primitive types is handled differently. The memory location associated with a primitive type contains the value (not an address) of the variable. For example, an int variable will have a memory location reserved for it whe re the value of the variable is stored. There is a subtle difference that may be hard to appreciate at this time: a variable (of type String ) holds a reference to the value instead of holding the actual value. The diagram below attempts to show the differe nce. Object References Since text strings are objects of type String another way to declare
