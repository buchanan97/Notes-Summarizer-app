Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org books Saylor.org Preface Maps are everywhere on the Internet, in your car, and even on your mobile phone. Moreover, maps of the twenty -first century are not just paper diagrams folded li ke an accordion. Maps today are colorful, searchable, interactive, and shared. This transformation of the static map into dynamic and interactive multimedia reflects the integration of technological innovation and vast amounts of geographic data. The key t echnology behind this integration, and subsequently the maps of the twenty -first century, is geographic information systems or GIS. Put simply, GIS is a special type of information technology that integrates data and information from various sources as map s. It is through this integration and mapping that the question of where has taken on new meaning. From getting directions to a new restaurant in San Francisco on your mobile device to exploring what will happen to coastal cities like Venice if oceans we re to rise due to global warming, GIS provides insights into daily tasks and the big challenges of the future. Essentials of Geographic Information Systems integrates key concepts behind the technology with practical concerns and real -world applications. R ecognizing that many potential GIS users are nonspecialists or may only need a few maps, this book is designed to be accessible, pragmatic, and concise. Essentials of Geographic Information Systems also illustrates how GIS is used to ask questions, inform choices, and guide policy.
