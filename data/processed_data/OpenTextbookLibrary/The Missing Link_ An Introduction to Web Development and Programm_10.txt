of how many 1015 ( with zeroes after it) calculations are completed per second. So, petaflops means the K computer can complete 1015 calculations ten times in one second. If we fed the UNIVAC just a single petaflop of data the day it was turned on, it would still be working on the problem today. In fact, it would barely be getting started, just a mere years into a roughly , -year task! ADDITIONAL NOTES You may have heard of Moore s Law, commonly defined as the tendency of technology s capability to double every two years. Moore s actual prediction was that this would apply to transistors, an element of circuits, and that it would continue for ten years after seeing its trend from 1958 to 1964. His prediction has shown to be applicable to memory capacity, speed, storage space as well as other factors and is commonly used as a bench mark for future growth. As cold war tensions grew and Sputnik was launched, the United States Department of Defense (Do D) began to seek additional methods of transmitting information to supple - ment existing methods. They sought something that was decentralized, allowing better resiliency in case of attack, where damage at one point would not necessarily disrupt com - munication. Their network, Arpanet, connected the Do D and participating universities together for the first time. In order to standardize the way networked systems commu - nicated, the Transfer Control Protocol Internetwork Protocol (TCP IP) was created. As various network systems migrated to this standard, they could then communicate with any network using the protocol. The Internet was born. Email was soon to follow, as users of the
