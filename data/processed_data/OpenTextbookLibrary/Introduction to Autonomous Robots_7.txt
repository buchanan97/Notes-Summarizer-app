dexterous, accurate, and even creative. Since this robot s appearance on the Tonight show, more than years have passed so how incredible must the capabilities of today s robots be and what must they be able to do? Interestingly, we only recently developed the techniques to autnomously do all of the things demonstrated by the Unimate. Unimate indeed did what was shown on TV, but all of its motions were preprogrammed and the environment was carefully staged. Only the advent of cheap and powerful sensors and the surge in computation capabilities have recently enabled robots to detect objects by themselves, plan motions to reach for them, and ultimately grasp and manipulate. Yet, robotics is still far away from doing these tasks with human-like performance. This book introduces you to the computational fundamentals behind the design and control of autonomous robots. Robots are considered to be autonomous when they make decisions in response to their environment (rather than simply following a pre-programmed set of motions). They achieve this using a multitude of modern techniques ranging from signal processing, control theory, artificial intelligence, and more. These techniques are tightly intertwined with the mechanics, the sensors, and the actuators of the robot. Designing a robot therefore requires a deep understanding of both algorithms . Introduction Figure . A wind-up toy that does not fall off the table using purely mechanical control. A fly-wheel that turns orthogonal to the robot s motion induces a right turn as soon as it hits the ground once the front caster wheel goes off the edge. and its interfaces to the physical world. The goals of this introductory chapter are to introduce the kind of problems roboticists deal
