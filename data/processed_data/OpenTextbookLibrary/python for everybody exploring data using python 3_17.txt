to the labels we use to refer to this stored data. x print(x) y x . TERMINOLOGY: INTERPRETER AND COMPILER print(y) In this example, we ask Python to remember the value six and use the label xso we can retrieve the value later. We verify that Python has actually remembered the value using print . Then we ask Python to retrieve xand multiply it by seven and put the newly computed value in y. Then we ask Python to print out the value currently in y. Even though we are typing these commands into Python one line at a time, Python is treating them as an ordered sequence of statements with later statements able to retrieve data created in earlier statements. We are writing our rst simpl e paragraph with four sentences in a logical and meaningful order. It is the nature of an interpreter to be able to have an interactive conversation as shown above. A compiler needs to be handed the entire program in a le, and then it runs a process to translate the high-level source code into machine language and then the compiler puts the resulting machine language into a le for later execution. If you have a Windows system, often these executable machine language programs have a su x of .exe or .dll which stand for executable and dynamic link library respectively. In Linux and Macintosh, there is no su x that uniquely marks a le as executable. If you were to open an executable le in a text editor, it would look completely crazy and be unreadable: ?ELF A A A B C A xa0 x82 D H4 x90 G ( ! F x80
