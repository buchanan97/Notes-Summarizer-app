can be altered without changing the original values of x and y. In this case, x and y are said to be local to the main() function while a and b are local to the add mult div() function. In other words, a isn t visible from main() so you can t accidentally alter it! Similarly, x isn t visible from add mult div(), so you can t accidentally alter it either. This is a positive boon when dealing with large programs using many variable names. While it s not usually preferred, there are times when you want a variable to be known everywhere . These are called global items. You can make variables global by simply declaring them at the beginning of the program outside of the functions (i.e., right after that initial comment in our example). Libraries The examples above are rather limited because, although they perform a calculation, we have no way of seeing the result! We need some way to print the answer to the computer screen. To do this, we rely on system functions and libraries. There are a series of libraries included with most C development systems to cover a variety of needs. Essentially, someone has already coded, tested and compiled a bunch of functions for you. You add these functions to your program through a process called linking. Linking simply combines your compiled code along with any required library code into a final executable program. For basic printouts, data input, and the like, we use the standard IO (Input Output) library , or stdio for short. There is a function in this library named printf() for print formatted .
