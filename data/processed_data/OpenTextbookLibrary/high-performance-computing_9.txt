unless there is some assurance you will eventually purchase the system. More often we evaluate the system s potential performance using benchmarks . There are industry benchmarks and your own locally developed benchmarks. Both types of benchmarks require some careful thought and planning for them to be an ef fective tool in determining the best system for your application. The Next Step Quite aside from economics, computer performance is a fascinating and challenging subject. Computer architecture is interesting in its own right and a topic that any computer professional should be comfortable with. Getting the last bit of per - formance out of an important application can be a stimulating exercise, in addition to an economic necessity . There are probably a few people who simply enjoy matching wits with a clever computer architecture. What do you need to get into the game? A basic understanding of modern computer architecture. Y ou don t need an advanced degree in computer engineering, but you do need to understand the basic terminology . A basic understanding of benchmarking, or performance measurement, so you can quantify your own successes and failures and use that information to improve the performance of your application. This book is intended to be an easily understood introduction and overview of high performance computing. It is an interesting field, and one that will become more important as we make even greater demands on our most common personal computers. In the high performance computer field, there is always a tradeof f between the single CPU performance and the performance of a multiple processor system. Multiple processor systems are generally more expensive and dif ficult to program (unless you have this
