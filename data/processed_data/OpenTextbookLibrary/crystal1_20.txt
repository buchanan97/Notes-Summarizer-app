it s just that we haven t bothered to name the variable. Also, notice that Btw, in this book, whenever I refer to a method, I ll be sure to put a dot before its name. For example, it s not the format() method, but the .format() method. CHAPTER . THREE KINDS OF ATOMIC DATA our code was too long to fit on one line nicely, so we broke it in two, and indented the second line to make it clear that price of wasn t starting its own new line. Crucially, all the bananas are still paired up, two-by-two, even though the left bananas are on a different line than the corresponding right bananas. Finally, here s a longer example with more variables: name "Pedro Pascal" num items cost print("Customer bought items worth .".format(name, num items, cost)) Customer Pedro Pascal bought items worth . You can see how we can pass more than one argument to a function method simply by separating them with commas inside the bananas. Chapter Memory pictures Now that we ve talked about the three important kinds of atomic variables, let s consider the question ofwhere they live. It might sound like a strange question. Aren t they in the Jupyter Notebook cell in which they were typed? Actually, no. And that brings me to the first mission-critical lesson of the semester, which is a bane to all students who don t deeply grasp it. The lesson is: The code itself is only a means to an end. The purpose of the code is to read or write what s in memory. Memoryis the part of the computer in which variables and their values are
