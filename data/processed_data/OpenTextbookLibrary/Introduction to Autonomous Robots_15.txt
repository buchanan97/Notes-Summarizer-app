kind of information that the car needs to be aware of and then discuss possible sensors that could capture this information. . Implement a simple line-following using a robot of your choice. How does the thickness of the line affect the sensor placement on the robot? How does its curvature affect the robot s maximum speed? . Implement a maze solving algorithm that uses simple wall-following using a robot of your choice. How does the sensor geometry affect the robot s performance? What are the parameters that you find yourself tuning? Part I. Mechanisms Chapter Locomotion, manipulation and their representations Autonomous robots are systems that sense, compute, communicate, and actuate. Actuation, the focus of this chapter, is the ability of the robot to move and to manipulate the world. Specifically, we differentiate between locomotion as the robot s ability to move itself and manipulation as the robot s ability to move objects in the environment. Both activities are closely related: during locomotion the robot uses its motors to exert forces on its environment (ground, water, or air) to move itself; during manipulation it uses motors to exert forces on objects to move them relative to the rest of the environment. This might not even require different motors. Insects are good examples for this: they can use their six legs not only for locomotion, but also for picking up and manipulating objects. In short, the goals of this chapter are to: Introduce the concepts of locomotion, manipulation and their duality, Explain static vs. dynamic stability, Introduce the concept of Degree of Freedom (Do F), introduce coordinate systems and their transformations. . Locomotion and manipulation examples Locomotion includes very different concepts of
