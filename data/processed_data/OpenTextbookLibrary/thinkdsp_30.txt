that are not in the signal. As an example, let's start with a sine signal that contains only one frequency component at Hz. Chapter .

As expected, there is a single peak at Hz. But if the duration is not a multiple of the period, bad things happen. With duration signal.period , the signal starts at and ends at . Figure (middle) shows the spectrum of this segment. Again, the peak is at Hz, but now there are additional components spread out from to Hz. This spread is called spectral leakage , because some of the energy that is actually at the fundamental frequency leaks into other frequencies. In this example, leakage happens because we are using DFT on a segment that becomes discontinuous when we treat it as periodic. . Windowing Time (s) Figure : Segment of a sinusoid (top), Hamming window (middle), product of the segment and the window (bottom). Windowing We can reduce leakage by smoothing out the discontinuity between the beginning and end of the segment, and one way to do that is windowing . A window" is a function designed to transform a non-periodic segment into something that can pass for periodic. Figure (top) shows a segment where the end does not connect
