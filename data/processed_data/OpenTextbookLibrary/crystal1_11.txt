years old! That vertical bar means this stuff is the printed result of executing the code cell. Easy enough. Onward! Chapter Three kinds of atomic data Atomic data When we say that some data is atomic, we don t mean it s radioactive; we mean it sindivisible. The ancients spoke of atoms as the smallest possible bits of matter. If you divide up any physical object say, an apple into parts, you get its components: a stalk, a stem, skin, seeds, and the sweet juicy stuff. Cut up any ofthosepieces with a knife and you get smaller pieces. If you continue to split and split and split, philosophers like Democritus reasoned, you ll eventually get to tiny indivisible bits that cannot be further dissected. This is where the physical world bottoms out at the finest degree of granularity. Similarly, a piece of atomic data is typically treated as an entire unit, not as something with internal structure that can be broken down. In the next chapter we ll learn about various ways that theseatomsofdatacanbestrungtogetherandorganizedintolarger wholes; fornow, though, we rejustlookingattheatomsthemselves. Environments and variables A data analysis program of which we will write many in this course makes use of anenvironmentas it runs. Environment just means all the data that is currently in view, and which the CHAPTER . THREE KINDS OF ATOMIC DATA program can access. The environment consists ofvariables, each of which (usually) has anameand avalue. For example, we might have a variable namedagewhose value is , and a variable named sloganwhose value is"Finger lickin good". Each variable in the environment must have adistinctname (i.e., no two variables can share the same name). Also, importantly, the reason these building blocks
