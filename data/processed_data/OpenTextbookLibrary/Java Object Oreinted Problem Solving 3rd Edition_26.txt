bank account are changed objects as a result of the transaction. What is an Object? So what is an object? Just as in the real world, an object is any thing whatsoever. An object can be a physical thing, such as a Car, or a mental thing, such as an Idea . It can be a natural thing, such as an Animal , or an arti cial, human-made thing, such as a ATM. A program that manages an ATM would involve Bank Account s and Customer objects. A chess program would involve a Board object and Chess Piece objects. Throughout this text, we will use the notation shown in Figure to depict objects and to illustrate object-oriented concepts. The notation is known as the Uni ed Modeling Language , or UML for short, and it is a standard in the object-oriented programming community. As the diagram shows, an object is represented by a rectangle whose label consists of the object s (optional) id and its type. An object s idis the name by which it is referred to in the computer program. In this case we show a ATM object, who s id is not given, and a Chess Piece object, named pawn1 . An object s label is always underlined. CHAPTER Computers, Objects, and Java Figure : In UML, objects are represented by rectangles that are labeled with a two-part label of the form id:Type . The object s label is always underlined. Attributes and Values Just as with real objects, the objects in our programs have certain characteristic attributes . For example, an ATM object would have a current amount of cash that it could dispense. A Chess
