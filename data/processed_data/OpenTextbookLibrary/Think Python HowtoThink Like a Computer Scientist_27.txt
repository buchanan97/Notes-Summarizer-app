an hour Everything from the to the end of the line is ignored it has no effect on the execution of the program. Comments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of the code. It is reasonable to assume that the reader can gure out what the code does; it is more useful to explain why. This comment is redundant with the code and useless: v assign to v This comment contains useful information that is not in the code: v velocity in meters second. Good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but long names can make complex expressions hard to read, so there is a tradeoff. Debugging Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and semantic errors. It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly. Syntax error: Syntax refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example, parentheses have to come in matching pairs, so ( ) is legal, but8)is asyntax error . If there is a syntax error anywhere in your program, Python displays an error message and quits, and you will not be able to run the program. During the rst few weeks of your programming career, you might spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and nd them faster. Runtime error: The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until after the program has started running. These errors are also called exceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened. Runtime
