many. Probability of connectivity For given values of nandp, we would like to know the probability that G(n;p) is connected. We can estimate it by generating a large number of random graphs and counting how many are connected. Here's how: def prob connected(n, p, iters ): tf is connected(make random graph(n, p)) for i in range(iters) return np.mean(bool) The parameters nandpare passed along to make random graph ;iters is the number of random graphs we generate. This function uses a list comprehension; if you are not familiar with this feature, you can read about it at http: thinkcomplex.com comp . The result, tf, is a list of boolean values: True for each graph that's connected and False for each one that's not. Probability of connectivity Prob of edge (p) Prob connectedn n n Figure : Probability of connectivity for several values of nand a range of p. np.mean is a Num Py function that computes the mean of this list, treating True as and False as . The result is the fraction of random graphs that are connected. prob connected( , , iters 10000) I chose : because it is close to the critical value where the probability of connectivity goes from near to near . According to Erd os and R enyi, p lnn n : . We can get a clearer view of the transition by estimating the probability of connectivity for a range of values of p: n ps np.logspace(- , , ) ys prob connected(n, p) for p in ps The Num Py function logspace returns an array of values from :5to , equally spaced on a logarithmic scale. For each value of pin the array,
