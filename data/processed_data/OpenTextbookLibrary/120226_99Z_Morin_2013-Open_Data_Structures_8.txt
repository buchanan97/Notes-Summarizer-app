Introduction terfaces implemented by all of the data structures described in this book and should be considered required reading. The remaining sections discuss: some mathematical review including exponentials, logarithms, factorials, asymptotic (big-Oh) notation, probability, and randomization; the model of computation; correctness, running time, and space; an overview of the rest of the chapters; and the sample code and typesetting conventions. A reader with or without a background in these areas can easily skip them now and come back to them later if necessary. Interfaces When discussing data structures, it is important to understand the difference between a data structure s interface and its implementation. An interface describes what a data structure does, while an implementation describes how the data structure does it. Aninterface , sometimes also called an abstract data type , de nes the set of operations supported by a data structure and the semantics, or meaning, of those operations. An interface tells us nothing about how the data structure implements these operations; it only provides a list of supported operations along with speci cations about what types of arguments each operation accepts and the value returned by each operation. A data structure implementation , on the other hand, includes the internal representation of the data structure as well as the de nitions of the algorithms that implement the operations supported by the data structure. Thus, there can be many implementations of a single interface. For example, in Chapter , we will see implementations of the List interface using arrays and in Chapter we will see implementations of the List interface using pointer-based data structures. Each implements the same interface, List , but in di erent ways. Interfaces x
