Manufactured products were intended for the working and middle classes, and high-quality output was not a goal. These products were never intended to vie for the attention of the upper classes enticing them away from the services and bespoke products of the craftsman (a contemporary example is T ip Top Tailors attracting Savile Row customers). Rather , they supplied common people with goods they had not been able to af ford before. This ef ficient line of thinking created the still existing equation of minimal design plus low material integrity equalling low-cost products. Design, rather than being a part of each step of production (implicit in the craftsman s approach), was added for form development and when a product needed more appeal for the masses usually during the later stages of production through decorative additions. Design was now directed by the parameters and constraints of the manufacturing process and its needs. Adv ertising Emerges Despite low product standards, the high quantities and low costs of manufactured goods stimulated a mass market and even greater demand (Meggs Purvis, , p. ). The historic role of graphic design for broadsheets and books expanded at this point to include advertising. Each company and product needed exposure to sell these manufactured products to the mass market no earlier method of promotion could communicate to this number of people.
