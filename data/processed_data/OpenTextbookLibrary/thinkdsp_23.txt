listen to the wave, can you hear the aliased harmonics? Chapter . Harmonics Exercise If you have a spectrum object, spectrum , and print the rst few values of spectrum.fs , you'll see that they start at zero. So spectrum.hs is the magnitude of the component with frequency . But what does that mean? Try this experiment: . Make a triangle signal with frequency and make a Wave with duration seconds. Plot the waveform. . Make a Spectrum object and print spectrum.hs . What is the amplitude and phase of this component? . Setspectrum.hs . Make a Wave from the modi ed Spectrum and plot it. What e ect does this operation have on the waveform? Exercise Write a function that takes a Spectrum as a parameter and modi es it by dividing each element of hsby the corresponding frequency fromfs. Hint: since division by zero is unde ned, you might want to set spectrum.hs . Test your function using a square, triangle, or sawtooth wave. . Compute the Spectrum and plot it. . Modify the Spectrum using your function and plot it again. . Make a Wave from the modi ed Spectrum and listen to it. What e ect does this operation have on the signal? Exercise Triangle and square waves have odd harmonics only; the sawtooth wave has both even and odd harmonics. The harmonics of the square and sawtooth waves drop o in proportion to f; the harmonics of the triangle wave drop o like f2. Can you nd a waveform that has even and odd harmonics that drop o like f2? Hint: There are two ways you could approach this: you could construct the signal you
