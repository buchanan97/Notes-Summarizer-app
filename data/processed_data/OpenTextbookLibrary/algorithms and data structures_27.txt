drawing statements into the normal code. Independent of the algorithm to be animated, you can call on your own collection of display and interaction procedures that you have built up in your frame program (in the section "A graphics frame program). But designing an adequate graphic representation is hard and requires a creative effort for each algorithm that is where animators programmers will spend the bulk of their effort. More on this topic in NVH . Example: the convex hull of points in the plane The following program is an illustrative example for algorithm animation. 'Convex Hull' animates an on-line algorithm that constructs half the convex hull (say, the upper half) of a set of points presented incrementally. It accepts one point at a time, which must lie to the right of all preceding ones, and immediately extends the convex hull. The algorithm is explained in detail in sample problems and algorithms . program Convex Hull; of n points in two dimensions constnmax ; max number of points r ; radius of point plot varx, y, dx, dy: array .. nmax of integer; b: array .. nmax of integer; backpointer n: integer; number of points entered so far px, py: integer; new point procedure Point Zero; begin n : ; x : ; y : ; the first point at fixed location dx : ; dy : ; assume vertical tangent b : ; points back to itself Paint Oval(y r, x r, y r, x r) end; function Next Right: boolean; begin if n nmax then Next Right : false else begin repeat until Button; while Button do Get Mouse(px, py); if px x n then Next Right :
