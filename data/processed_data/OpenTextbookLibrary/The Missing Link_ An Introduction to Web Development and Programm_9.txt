led the military to seek a method of commu - nicating that could withstand attack. At the same time, university researchers were trying to share their work between campuses, and were struggling with similar problems when their transmissions suffered drops in signal. Parties from both groups ended up at the same conference with presentations, and decided to collaborate in order to further their work. At the time, computers were far from what we know them as today. A single computer was a large, immobile assortment of equipment that took up an entire room.

The image below depicts the UNIVAC , a system used by the United States Census Bureau and other large organizations like universities. One of the fastest machines at the time, it could perform roughly 1000 calculations per second.

Before The Missing Link: An Introduction to Web Development and Programming Chapter you reach for your dictionary or calculator, we will break that down. FLOPS stands for floating point operations per second, or in basic terms, the number of calculations the system can finish in one second. A petaflop is a numerical indicator
