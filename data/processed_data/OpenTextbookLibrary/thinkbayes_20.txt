the t w o b o wls. The M M problem M M's are small candy-coated c ho colates that come in a v ariet y of colors. Mars, Inc., whic h mak es M M's, c hanges the mixture of colors from time to time. In 1995, they in tro duced blue M M's. Before then, the color mix in a bag of plain M M's w as Bro wn, Y ello w, Red, Green, Orange, T an. Afterw ard it w as Blue , Green, Orange, Y ello w, Red, Bro wn. Supp ose a friend of mine has t w o bags of M M's, and he tells me that one is from 1994 and one from 1996. He w on't tell me whic h is whic h, but he giv es me one M M from eac h bag. One is y ello w and one is green. What is the probabilit y that the y ello w one came from the 1994 bag? . The M M problem This problem is similar to the co okie problem, with the t wist that I dra w one sample from eac h b o wl bag. This problem also giv es me a c hance to demonstrate the table metho d, whic h is useful for solving problems lik e this on pap er. In the next c hapter w e will solv e them computationally . The rst step is to en umerate the h yp otheses. The bag the y ello w M M came from I'll call Bag ; I'll call the other Bag . So the h yp otheses are: A: Bag is
