for pin both places where it occurs in ( p) p. How can I be sure that all these in nitely many statements are valid when all t hat I ve checked is one little two-line truth table? The answer is that any giv en proposition, Q, no matter how complicated, has a particular truth value, eit her true or false. So, the question of the validity of ( Q) Qalways reduces to one of the two cases I already checked in the truth table. (Note that for thi s argument to be valid, the same Qmust be substituted for pin every position where it occurs.) While this argument may be obvious, it is not exactly a proo f, but for now we will just accept the validity of the following theorem: Theorem (First Substitution Law) .Suppose that Qis any proposition, and thatpis a propositional variable. Consider any tautology. If (Q)is substituted forpin all places where poccurs in the tautology, then the result is also a tautology. Since logical equivalence is de ned in terms of tautology, i t is also true that when (Q) is substituted for pin a logical equivalence, the result is again a logical equivalence. The First Substitution Law lets you do algebra! For example, you can substitutep qforpin the law of double negation, ( p) p. This allows you to simplify the expression ( (p q)) top qwith con dence that the resulting expression has the same logical value as the expre ssion you started with. (That s what it means for ( (p q)) andp qto be logically equivalent.) You can play similar tricks with all the laws in Figur e1. . Even more
