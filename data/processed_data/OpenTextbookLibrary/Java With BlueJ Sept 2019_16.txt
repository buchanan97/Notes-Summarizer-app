Java evaluates these requires knowledg e of operator priorities and associativity. Operator Priorities Java gives each operator a priority and then uses those priorities to control the order of evaluation for an expression. Higher priority operators are executed before lower priority operators. Sometimes a programmer may need to override these priorities and would use a sub -expression for that purpose; a sub -expression is always evaluated before the expression in which it is contained is evaluated. Consider the following table of operator priori ties: Operator Priorities Highest to lowest - Multiplication is given the same priority as division and modulo, and addition is given the same priority as subtraction. However, the priority of multiplication, division, and modulo is higher than that of addition and subtraction. The following table shows expressions, the order of evaluation shown with equivalent sub -expressions, and the final result. Java expressions involving priorities expression equivalent evaluation final result ( ) - - ( ) ( ) The next two examples show situations where operator priorities must be overridden in order to have correct calculations: Example: Calculate Net Pay Supp ose we must calculate an employee s net pay. Suppose for the employee we have their gross pay, deductions from gross, and their tax rate in variables named gross Pay , deductions , and tax Rate respectively. Suppose net pay is calculated by subtracting deducti ons from gross pay and then multiplying by the tax rate. If we code this as gross Pay - deductions tax Rate we will get the wrong result since has higher priority than -. We need use a sub -expression as: (gross Pay - deductions ) tax Rate Example: Calcula te Area
