usually along a line. In order to determine direction, a reference point or benchmark from which direction will be measured needs to be established. One of the most common benchmarks used to determine direction is ourselves. Egocentric direction refers to when we use ourselves as a directional benchmark. Describing something as to my left, behind me, or next to me are examples of egocentric direction.

Such landmarks may be a busy intersection of a city, a prominent point of interest like the Colosseum in Rome, or some other feature lik e a mountain range or river. The important thing to remember about landmark direction, especially when providing directions, is that the landmark should be relatively well -known. In geography and GISs, there are three more standard benchmarks that are used to define the directions of true north, magnetic north, and grid north. True north is based on the point at which the axis of the earth s rotation intersects the earth s surface. In this respect the North and South Poles serve as the geographic benchmarks for determining direction. Magnetic north (and south) refers to the point on the surface of the earth where the earth s magnetic fields converge. This is also the point to which magnetic compasses point. Note that magnetic north falls somewhere in norther n Canada and is not geographically coincident with true north or the North Pole. Grid north simply refers to the northward direction that the grid lines of latitude and longitude on a map, called a graticule, point
