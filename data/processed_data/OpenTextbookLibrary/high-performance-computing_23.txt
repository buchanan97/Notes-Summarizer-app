A and B both take up exactly KB of storage, and their inclusion together in COMMON assures that the arrays start exactly KB apart in memory . In a -KB direct mapped cache, the same line that is used for A( ) is used for B( ), and likewise for A( ) and B( ), etc., so alternating references cause repeated cache misses. T o fix it, you could either adjust the size of the array A, or put some other variables into COMMON , between them. For this reason one should generally avoid array dimensions that are close to powers of two. Fully Associative Cache At the other extreme from a direct mapped cache is a fully associative cache , where any memory location can be mapped into any cache line, regardless of memory address. Fully associative caches get their name from the type of memory used to construct them associative memory . Associative memory is like regular memory , except that each memory cell knows something about the data it contains. When the processor goes looking for a piece of data, the cache lines are asked all at once whether any of them has it. The cache line containing the data holds up its hand and says I have it ; if none of them do, there is a cache miss. It then becomes a question of which cache line will be replaced with the new data. Rather than map memory locations to cache lines via an algorithm, like a direct- mapped cache, the memory system can ask the fully associative cache lines to choose among themselves which memory locations they will represent.
