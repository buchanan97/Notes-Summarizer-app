documents. Secondly, as society has benefitted from the introduction of computers, so too have libraries. Computers-in-Libraries is its own wide ranging and active area of study, with conferences and publications. Computers-in-Libraries includes AI uses and more besides. As examples of the more besides, the issuing and tracking of books typically will use computers and databases, as will the financial record systems for the salaries and payment of librarians. AI in libraries is different to automation and plain computing. Wherein do the differences lie? The use, or simulation, of intelligence, is the main one. What about some further actual and potential examples from librarianship? There is machine translation of texts from one natural language to another. There are recommender systems that can recommend books or resources to patrons. There are, or have been, intelligent assistants in libraries, such as Stella, Beacon, or Bizzy, that can answer reference questions and conduct reference interviews (Sanji, Behzadi, and Gomroki 2022). There are the very familiar search engines and OPACs(Online Public Access Catalogs) Discovery Systems, most of which have AI components. Final example: AI can add value to the recorded knowledge in libraries by extracting, synthesizing, and summarizing that knowledge. There is an abundance of recorded knowledge in libraries. The sheer volume of the recordings would overwhelm a librarian or team of librarians. Yet, the Lithium Ion encyclopedia was written by a computer program running deep text analysis of holdings within libraries (Writer 2019). AI has made massive advances in the last years or so, especially in the areas of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). Both these approaches involve learning. Back in 1959, Arthur Samuel wrote: a computer can be programmed so that
