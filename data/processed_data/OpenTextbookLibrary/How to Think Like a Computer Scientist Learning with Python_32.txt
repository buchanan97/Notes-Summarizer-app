it doesn t do anything. The script Hello, World! produces no output at all. How would you change the script to display the values of these four expressions? Operators and operands Operators and operands Operators are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication. The values the operator uses are called operands . The following are all legal Python expressions whose meaning is more or less clear: hour- hour minute minute ( ) ( - ) The symbols ,-, and , and the use of parenthesis for grouping, mean in Python what they mean in mathematics. The asterisk ( ) is the symbol for multiplication, and is the symbol for exponentiation. When a variable name appears in the place of an operand, it is replaced with its value before the operation is performed. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation all do what you expect , but you might be surprised by division. The following operation has an unexpect ed result: minute minute The value of minute is , and in conventional arithmetic divided by is , not . The reason for the discrepancy is that Python is performing integer division . When both of the operands are integers, the result must also be an integer, and by convention, integer division always rounds down, even in cases like this where the next integer is very close. A possible solution to this problem is to calculate a percentage rather than a fraction: minute Again the result is rounded down, but at least now the answer is approximately correct. Another alternative is to use oating-point division, which we get to in Chapter . Order of operations When more than one operator appears in
