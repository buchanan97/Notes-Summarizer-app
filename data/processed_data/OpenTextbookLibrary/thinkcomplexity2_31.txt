of the cliquishness" of the graph. In a graph, aclique is a subset of nodes that are all connected to each other; in a social network, a clique is a set of people who are all friends with each other. Watts and Strogatz de ned a clustering coe cient that quanti es the likelihood that two nodes that are connected to the same node are also connected to each other. Path length is a measure of the average distance between two nodes, which corresponds to the degrees of separation in a social network. Watts and Strogatz show that regular graphs have high clustering and high path lengths, whereas random graphs with the same size usually have low clustering and low path lengths. So neither of these is a good model of social networks, which combine high clustering with short path lengths. Their goal was to create a generative model of a social network. A generative model tries to explain a phenomenon by modeling the process that builds or leads to the phenomenon. Watts and Strogatz proposed this process for building small-world graphs: . Start with a regular graph with nnodes and each node connected to k neighbors. . Choose a subset of the edges and rewire" them by replacing them with random edges. The probability that an edge is rewired is a parameter, p, that controls how random the graph is. With p , the graph is regular; with p it is completely random. Watts and Strogatz found that small values of pyield graphs with high clustering, like a regular graph, and low path lengths, like a random graph. In this chapter I replicate the Watts and Strogatz experiment in
