in addition to primitive numbers. We need to represent arithmetic expressions . What are the rules that govern nesting of arithmetic expressions? We re actually free to nest any expression inside another. Do Now! Why did we not include division? What impact does it have on the remarks above? We ve ignored division because it forces us into a discussion of what expressions we might consider legal: clearly the representation of 2ought to be legal; the representation of 0is much more debatable; and that of ( - ) seems even more controversial. We d like to sidestep this controversy for now and return to it later REF . Thus, we want a representation for numbers and arbitrarily nestable addition and multiplication. Here s one we can use: (define-type Arith C num C (n : number) plus C (l : Arith C) (r : Arith C) mult C (l : Arith C) (r : Arith C) ) Writing an Interpreter Now let s write an interpreter for this arithmetic language. First, we should think about what its type is. It clearly consumes a Arith C value. What does it produce? Well, an interpreter evaluates and what kind of value might arithmetic expressions reduce to? Numbers, of course. So the interpreter is going to be a function from arithmetic expressions to numbers. Exercise Write your test cases for the interpreter. Because we have a recursive datatype, it is natural to structure our interpreter as a recursive function over it. Here s a rst template: Templates are explained in great detail in How to Design Programs.(define (interp a : Arith C ) : number (type-case Arith C a num C (n) n plus
