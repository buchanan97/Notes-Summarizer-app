include individual decisions based on local information, and ignore every other aspect of human behavior. But there are di erences of degree. For planetary motion, we can defend the model by showing that the forces we ignore are smaller than the ones we include. And we can extend the model to include other interactions and The changing criteria of science show that the e ect is small. For Schelling's model it is harder to justify the simpli cations. Another di erence is that Schelling's model doesn't appeal to any physical laws, and it uses only simple computation, not mathematical derivation. Models like Schelling's don't look like classical science, and many people nd them less compelling, at least at rst. But as I will try to demonstrate, these models do useful work, including prediction, explanation, and design. One of the goals of this book is to explain how. The changing criteria of science Complexity science is not just a di erent set of models; it is also a gradual shift in the criteria models are judged by, and in the kinds of models that are considered acceptable. For example, classical models tend to be law-based, expressed in the form of equations, and solved by mathematical derivation. Models that fall under the umbrella of complexity are often rule-based, expressed as computations, and simulated rather than analyzed. Not everyone nds these models satisfactory. For example, in Sync, Steven Strogatz writes about his model of spontaneous synchronization in some species of re ies. He presents a simulation that demonstrates the phenomenon, but then writes: I repeated the simulation dozens of times, for other random initial conditions and for other numbers of oscillators.
