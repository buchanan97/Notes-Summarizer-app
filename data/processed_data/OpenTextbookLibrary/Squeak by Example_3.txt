Squeak is a modern, open source, fully-featured implementation of the Smalltalk programming language and environment. Squeak is highly portable even its virtual machine is written entirely in Smalltalk, making it easy to debug, analyze, and change. Squeak is the vehicle for a wide range of innovative projects from multimedia applications and educational platforms to commercial web development environments. Who should read this book? This book presents the various aspects of Squeak, starting with the basics, and proceeding to more advanced topics. This book will not teach you how to program. The reader should have some familiarity with programming languages. Some background with object-oriented programming would be helpful. This book will introduce the Squeak programming environment, the language and the associated tools. You will be exposed to common idioms and practices, but the focus is on the technology, not on object-oriented design. Wherever possible, we will show you lots of examples. (We have been inspired by Alec Sharp s excellent book on Smalltalk1.) There are numerous other books on Smalltalk freely available on the web but none of these focuses speci cally on Squeak.
