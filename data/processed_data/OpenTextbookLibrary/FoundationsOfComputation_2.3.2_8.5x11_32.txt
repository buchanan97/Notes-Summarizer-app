identi ed and represented as a logic gate, you just have to build circuits to compute the input or inputs to that operator. In the example, the inputs to the main andgate come from two subcircuits. One subcircuit computes the value of A Band the other computes the value of (A B). Building each subcircuit is a separate problem, but small er than the problem you started with. Eventually, you ll come to a gate w hose input comes directly from one of the input wires Aor Bin this case instead of from a subcircuit. So, every compound proposition is computed by a logic circui t with one output wire. Is the reverse true? That is, given a logic circu it with one output, isthereapropositionthatexpressesthevalueoftheoutput intermsofthevalues of the inputs? Not quite. When you wire together some logic ga tes to make a circuit, thereisnothingtostopyoufromintroducingfeedb ackloops. Afeedback loop occurs when the output from a gate is connected possibly through one or more intermediate gates back to an input of the same gate. F igure1. shows an example of a circuit with a feedback loop. Feedback l oops cannot be describedbycompoundpropositions, basicallybecausethe reisnoplacetostart, no input to associate with a propositional variable. But fee dback loops are the only thing that can go wrong. A logic circuit that does not con tain any feedback loopsiscalleda combinatorial logic circuit . Everycombinatoriallogiccircuit with just one output computes the value of some compound prop osition. The propositional variables in the compound proposition are ju st names associated with the input wires of the circuit. (Of course, if the circui t has more than one output, you can simply use a di erent proposition for each ou
