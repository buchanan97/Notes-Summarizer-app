VALIDATION AND TEXT MANIPULATION Figure : Assertion error on running Calculate Age. Assert statements are used by programmers when they are developing and testing code. They should not be used in production code. Blue J, by default, enables assertions. This default behaviour is reasonable for an environment that is a learning environment, but assertions can be turned o . At the time of writing assertions can be disabled by changing a ag in the Blue J defs le from eatoda. . VALIDATING PARAMETERS Validating parameters When a method has been coded there is an expectation that the argument values passed in are appropriate. For instance, the get Age method in the previous section expects a string argument to contain a valid date. What happens if it does not? Examine that code and you should agree that the method will fail and the program will terminate. The programmer would then need to investigate to determine why the program failed. Instead of leaving things that way we can redevelop get Age so it checks its parameters and when they are invalid it could fail, but indicate to us the nature of the problem, and the programmer who is debugging the code will know where to begin her his investigation. Whenever you develop a method that has parameters you should know
