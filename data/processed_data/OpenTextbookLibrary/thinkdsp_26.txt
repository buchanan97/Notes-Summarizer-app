dtyields d dt f(t) In other words, frequency is the derivative of phase. Conversely, phase is the integral of frequency. When we used cumsum to go from frequency to phase, we were approximating integration. Exponential chirp When you listen to this chirp, you might notice that the pitch rises quickly at rst and then slows down. The chirp spans two octaves, but it only takes s to span the rst octave, and twice as long to span the second. Chapter . Non-periodic signals The reason is that our perception of pitch depends on the logarithm of frequency. As a result, the interval we hear between two notes depends on the ratio of their frequencies, not the di erence. Interval" is the musical term for the perceived di erence between two pitches. For example, an octave is an interval where the ratio of two pitches is . So the interval from to is one octave and the interval from to is also one octave. The di erence in frequency is bigger, but the ratio is the same. As a result, if frequency increases linearly, as in a linear chirp, the perceived pitch increases logarithmically. If you want the perceived pitch to increase linearly, the frequency has to increase exponentially. A signal with that shape is called an exponential chirp . Here's the code that makes one: class Expo Chirp(Chirp): def evaluate(self, ts): start, end np.log10(self.start), np.log10(self.end) freqs np.logspace(start, end, len(ts)- ) return self. evaluate(ts, freqs) Instead of np.linspace , this version of evaluate uses np.logspace , which creates a series of frequencies whose logarithms are equally spaced, which means that they increase exponentially. That's it; everything else is the same as
