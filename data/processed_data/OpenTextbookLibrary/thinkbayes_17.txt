wl , whic h is . p(V) : This is the probabilit y of dra wing a v anilla co okie from either b o wl. Since w e had an equal c hance of c ho osing either b o wl and the b o wls con tain the same n um b er of co okies, w e had the same c hance of c ho osing an y co okie. Bet w een the t w o b o wls there are v anilla and c ho colate co okies, so p(V) . Putting it together, w e ha v e p(B1j V) ( ) ( ) whic h reduces to . So the v anilla co okie is evidence in fa v or of the h yp othesis that w e c hose Bo wl , b ecause v anilla co okies are more lik ely to come from Bo wl . . The diac hronic in terpretation This example demonstrates one use of Ba y es's theorem: it pro vides a strategy to get from p(Bj A) top(Aj B) . This strategy is useful in cases, lik e the co okie problem, where it is easier to compute the terms on the righ t side of Ba y es's theorem than the term on the left. The diac hronic in terpretation There is another w a y to think of Ba y es's theorem: it giv es us a w a y to up date the probabilit y of a h yp othesis, H , in ligh t of some b o dy of data, D . This w a y of thinking ab out
