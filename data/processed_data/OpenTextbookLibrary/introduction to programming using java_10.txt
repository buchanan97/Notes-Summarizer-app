This includes translation s to other languages. For uses of the book in ways not covered by the license, permis sion of the author is required. A technical note on production: The on-line and PDF versions of this book are created from a single source, which is written largely in XML. To prod uce the PDF version, the XML is processed into a form that can be used by the Te X typesettin g program. In addition to XML les, the source includes DTDs, XSLT transformations, Java source code les, image les, a Te X macro le, and a couple of scripts that are used in process ing. The scripts work on Linux and on Mac OS. I have made the complete source les available f or download here: https: math.hws.edu eck cs124 downloads javanotes9 -full-source.zip These les were not originally meant for publication, and th erefore are not very cleanly written. Furthermore, it requires a fair amount of expertis e to use them. However, I have had several requests for the sources and have made them availabl e on an as-is basis. For more information about the sources and how they are used see the RE ADME le from the source download. The source les for the Java FX edition and for the Swing editi on are actually generated from a common set of source les that would be even harder to us e. If you are interested in exploring them, those ultimate source les can be found on Gi thub. You can browse the les online, or you can clone the git repository, using the follow ing URL: https: github.com davidjeck javanotes9 Professor David J. Eck Department of
