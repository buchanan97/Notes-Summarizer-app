feedback that the maximum transmission rate has been reached. For further discussion, including alternative de nitions of longer-term congestion, see BCL09 . Congestion isa sign of a problem in real-time networks, which we will consider in Quality of Service . In these networks losses due to congestion must generally be kept to an absolute minimum; one way to achieve this is to limit the acceptance of new connections unless suf cient resources are available. Packets Again Perhaps the core justi cation for packets, Baran s concerns about node failure notwithstanding, is that the same link can carry, at different times, different packets representing traf c to different destinations and from different senders. Thus, packets are the key to supporting shared transmission lines ; that is, they support themultiplexing of multiple communications channels over a single cable. The alternative of a separate physical line between every pair of machines grows prohibitively complex very quickly (though virtual circuits between every pair of machines in a datacenter are not uncommon; see Virtual Circuits ). From this shared-medium perspective, an important packet feature is the maximum packet size, as this represents the maximum time a sender can send before other senders get a chance. The alternative of unbounded packet sizes would lead to prolonged network unavailability for everyone else if someone downloaded a large le in a single Gigabit packet. Another drawback to large packets is that, if the packet is corrupted, the entire packet must be retransmitted; see Error Rates and Packet Size . Packets Again An Introduction to Computer Networks, Release When a router or switch receives a packet, it (generally) reads in the entire packet before looking at the header to
