rectangle will be assigned to the bounds variable, inherited from the superclass. Note that the origin of the Squeak screen is the top left , and the ycoordinate increases downwards . The rest of the method should be self-explanatory. Part of the art of writing good Smalltalk code is to pick good method names so that Smalltalk code can be read like a kind of pidgin English. You should be able to imagine the object talking to itself and saying Self use square corners! , Self turn off! . Inspecting an object You can test the effect of the code you have written by creating a new SBECell object and inspecting it. Open a workspace. Type the expression SBECell new and inspect it . The left-hand pane of the inspector shows a list of instance variables; if you select one (try bounds ),the value of the instance variable is shown in the right pane. You can also use the inspector to change the value of an instance variable. Change the value of bounds to0 corner: and accept it. Inspecting an object Figure : The inspector used to examine a SBECell object. The bottom pane of the inspector is a mini-workspace. It s useful because in this workspace the pseudo-variable selfis bound to the object being inspected. Type the text self open In World in the bottom pane and do it. The cell should appear at the top left-hand corner of the screen, indeed, exactly where its bounds say that it should appear. Blue-click on the cell to bring up the morphic halo. Move the cell with the brown (next to top-right) handle and resize it with the yellow (bottom-right) handle.
