program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure. Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal languages) . First, remember that formal languages are much more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is very importan t, so it is usually not a good idea to read from top to bottom, left to right. I nstead, The way of the program learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details matter. Little things like spelling erro rs and bad punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big di erence in a formal language. The rst program Traditionally, the rst program written in a new language is called Hello, World! because all it does is display the words, Hello, World! In Python, it looks like this: print "Hello, World!" This is an example of a print statement , which doesn t actually print anything on paper. It displays a value on the screen. In this case, the result is the words Hello, World! The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the value; they don t appear in the result. Some people judge the quality of a programming language by the simplicity of the Hello, World! program. By this standard, Python does about as well as possible.
