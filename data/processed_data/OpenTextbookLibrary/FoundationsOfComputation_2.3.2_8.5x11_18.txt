identical shows th e logical equivalence of pand ( p). The point here is not just that ( p) p, but also that this logical equivalence is valid because it can be veri ed c omputationally based just on the relevant de nitions. Its validity does notfollow from the fact that it s obvious or it s a well-known rule of grammar. Stude nts often ask Why do I have to prove something when it s obvious. The point is t hat logic and mathematics more generally is its own little world with its o wn set of rules. Although this world is related somehow to the real world, whe n you say that something is obvious (in the real world), you aren t playing by the rules of the world of logic. The real magicof mathematics is that by playing by its rules, you can come up with things that are decidedly not obvious, bu t that still say something about the real world often, something interestin g and important. Each of the rules in Figure .2can be veri ed in the same way, by making a truth table to check all the possible cases. It s important to understand that the propositional variab les in the laws of Boolean algebra can stand for any propositions, including c ompound propositions. It is not just true, as the Double Negation Law states, that ( p) p. It is also true that ( q) q, that ( (p q)) (p q), that ( (p (q p))) (p (q p)), and an in nite number of other statements of the same form .
