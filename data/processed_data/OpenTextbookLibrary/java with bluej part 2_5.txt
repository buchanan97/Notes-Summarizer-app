When to use the enhanced for The enhanced forhelps to express a programming idiom succinctly as no loop counter is required. However, there are many cases where the enhanced forcannot be used: . iterate backwards through the array elements . access elements of more than one array . partially lled arrays (discussed later) . assigning new values to array elements. CHAPTER . ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS Passing string values into main() In all of our main methods we have speci ed a String array named args : public static void main(String args) In the above line args is declared to be an array of String . The variable args is used to pass values (that are strings) into a method. When you have used Blue J to execute the main() method you have the opportunity to pass an array of strings to the program. Example Passing arguments to main() The following program just lists the strings passed into the program. Listing : String values passed into main() . Print the values passed into the program 4public class Args public static void main ( String args ) System .out . println ("The elements of args :"); for ( String s: args ) System .out. print (" " s); The following shows a user executing main() and passing in strings with the resulting output from the program: . PASSING STRING VALUES INTO MAIN() CHAPTER . ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS Parallel arrays There are times when two or more arrays have exactly the same number of elements and where array elements at the same index relate to one another in some meaningful way. For example suppose we have one array of student names and another of student
