a computer's resources. For example, while one computation is stalled waiting for input to arrive, another computation can be making productive use of the processor. A variety of words can be used to refer to the computations underway on a computer; they may be called threads, processes, tasks, or jobs. In this book, I will use both the word thread" and the word process," and it is important that I explain now the di erence between them. Athread is the fundamental unit of concurrency. Any one sequence of programmed actions is a thread. Executing a program might create multiple threads, if the program calls for several independent sequences of actions run concurrently with one another. Even if each execution of a program creates only a single thread, which is the more normal case, a typical system will be running several threads: one for each ongoing program execution, as well as some that are internal parts of the operating system itself. When you start a program running, you are always creating one or more threads. However, you are also creating a process . The process is a container that holds the thread or threads that you started running and protects them from unwanted interactions with other unrelated threads running on the same computer. For example, a thread running in one process cannot accidentally overwrite memory in use by a di erent process. Because human users normally start a new process running every time they want to make a new computation happen, it is tempting to think of processes as the unit of concurrent execution. This temptation is amplied by the fact that older operating systems required each process to have exactly
