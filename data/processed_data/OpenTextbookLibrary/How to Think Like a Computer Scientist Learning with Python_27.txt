A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to execute; also called machine language or assembly language. portability: A property of a program that can run on more than one kind of computer. interpret: To execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one line at a time. compile: To translate a program written in a high-level language into a low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution. Glossary source code: A program in a high-level language before being compiled. object code: The output of the compiler after it translates the program. executable: Another name for object code that is ready to be executed. script: A program stored in a le (usually one that will be interpreted). program: A set of instructions that speci es a computation. algorithm: A general process for solving a category of problems. bug: An error in a program. debugging: The process of nding and removing any of the three kinds of programming errors. syntax: The structure of a program. syntax error: An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse (and therefore impossible to interpret). runtime error: An error that does not occur until the program has started to execute but that prevents the program from continuing. exception: Another name for a runtime error. semantic error: An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended. semantics: The meaning of a program. natural language: Any one of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally. formal language: Any one of the languages that people have designed for speci c purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs; all
