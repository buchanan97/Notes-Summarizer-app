Chapter Arrays of Arrays Java programmers frequently use an array (also called a one-dimensional array) to deal with a linear collection of elements (where the elements are of the same type). However there are times when a more complicated array structure is useful. For instance suppose we are keeping track of snowfall by month for Denver, Colorado, for the years 2000 through to 2014.
