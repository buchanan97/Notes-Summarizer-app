is a formal langua ge that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols . Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly: Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations. Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax. For example, is a syntactically correct mathematical statement, but is not. H2 Ois a syntactically correct chemical name, but Zzis not. Syntax rules come in two avors, pertaining to tokens and structure. Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the problems with is that is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as we know). Similarly, Zzis not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation Zz. The second type of syntax error pertains to the structure of a statement that is, the way the tokens are arranged. The statement is structurally illegal because you can t place a plus sign immediately after an equal sign. Similarly, molecular formulas have to have subscripts after the element name, not before. As an exercise, create what appears to be a well-structured En glish sentence with unrecognizable tokens in it. Then write anoth er sentence with all valid tokens but with invalid structure. Formal and natural languages When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to gure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called parsing . For example, when you hear the sentence, The other shoe fell, you understand that the other shoe is
