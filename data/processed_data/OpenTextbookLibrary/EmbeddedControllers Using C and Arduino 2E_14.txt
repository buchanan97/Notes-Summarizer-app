and returns a floating point value will look something like this: float my function( int x, int y ) appropriate statements here If the function doesn t take or return values, the word void is used. If a function neither requires values nor returns a value, it would look like: void other function( void ) appropriate statements here This may appear to be extra fussy work at first, but the listing of data types makes a lot of sense because C has something called type checking. This means that if you try to send a function the wrong kind of variable, or even the wrong number of variables, the compiler will warn you that you ve made a mistake! Thus if you try to send my function() above two floats or three integers, the compiler will complain and save you a big headache during testing. All programs must have a place to start, and in C, program execution begins with a function called main. This does not have to be the first function written or listed, but all programs must have a function called main. Here s our first program, found in Figure , following: Embedded Controllers Our first program void main( void ) float x ; float y ; float z; z x y (x y); Figure , a simple program There is only one function here, main(). It takes no variables and returns nothing. What s the other stuff? First, the pair denotes a comment2. Anything inside of the comment pair is ignored by the compiler. A C comment can stretch for many lines. Once inside the function, three variables are declared with two of them given initial
