into the appropriate machine language. There is an alternative to compiling a high-level language p rogram. Instead of using a compiler,whichtranslatestheprogramallatonce,youcanu seaninterpreter ,whichtranslates it instruction-by-instruction, as necessary. An interpre ter is a program that acts much like a CPU, with a kind of fetch-and-execute cycle. In order to exec ute a program, the interpreter runs in a loop in which it repeatedly reads one instruction fr om the program, decides what is necessary to carry out that instruction, and then performs t he appropriate machine-language commands to do so. (A compiler is like a human translator who translates an enti re book from one language to another, producing a new book in the second language. An inte rpreter is more like a human interpreter who translates a speech at the United Nations fr om one language to another at the same time that the speech is being given.) One use of interpreters is to execute high-level language pr ograms. For example, the programming language Lisp is usually executed by an interpr eter rather than a compiler. However, interpreters have another purpose: They can let yo u use a machine-language program meant for one type of computer on a completely di erent type o f computer. For example, one of the original home computers was the Commodore or C64 . While you might not nd an actual C64, you can nd programs that run on other computers or even in a web browser that emulate one. Such an emulator can run C64 programs by a cting as an interpreter for the C64 machine language. The designers of Java chose to use a combination of compiling and interpreting.
