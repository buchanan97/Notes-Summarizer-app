. Run the Hello World program. . Modify the Hello World program so it displays your name instead of Hello World . To do this you must u se the Blue J editor and alter line . Then you must recompile the program and run the new version. Basics This chapter covers material that gives you the necessary information to run basic programs that use constants and variables, perform calculations, obtain input from a user, and generate output. The topics covered are literals , variables, primitive data types, the String class, input, and output. Java is an object -oriented language and with the last three topics you will begin to get an understanding of what object -oriented means. Literals, variables, and the primitive data types are concepts you will find in most (if not all) programming languages you encounter. Literals It is common for programs to include constants; in Java these are referred to as literals. Examples include: , , a , "Gosling", true. Most of the time a programmer codes numeric literals and boolean literals in the same way we would normally write them down (e.g. , , true, false). With practice you will get used to using single quotes to specify a single character (e.g. a ), or double quotes to specify a text string (e.g. "Gosling" ). Variables The variable is a fundamental concept in programming. In general terms we say a variable is a named location in a computer s memory, and the value stored in that location is controlled during the execution of programs. A variable is a name associated with a piece of computer memory - a piece of memory that holds a value
