x86 As sembly Language, POSIX, and Python. The students who took the class helped me nd errors in the rs t edition and several of them contributed solutions that were better than mine. At the end of the semester, I asked each of them to write a new, original pro blem (preferably with a solution). I have added their contributions to the sec ond edition. Also since the rst edition appeared, Kenneth Reek presente d the article Design Patterns for Semaphores at the ACM Special Interes t Group for Computer Science Education. He presents a problem, which I have cast as the Sushi Bar Problem, and two solutions that demonstrate patterns he calls Pass the baton and I ll do it for you. Once I came to appreciate thes e patterns, I was able to apply them to some of the problems from the rst editio n and produce solutions that I think are better. One other change in the second edition is the syntax. After I w rote the rst edition, I learned Python, which is not only a great programm ing language; it also makes a great pseudocode language. So I switched from th e C-like syntax in the rst edition to syntax that is pretty close to executab le Python1. In fact, I have written a simulator that can execute many of the soluti ons in this book. Readers who are not familiar with Python will (I hope) nd it m ostly obvious. In cases where I use a Python-speci c feature, I expla in the syntax and what it means. I hope that these changes make the book more rea dable. The pagination of this book
