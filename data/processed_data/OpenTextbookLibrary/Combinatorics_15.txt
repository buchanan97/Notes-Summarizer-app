of binary information, and we want the computer to store it so we can detect if an error has arisen. There are two symbols we need to encode: and . If we just use 0as the code for indicating 0and 1as the code for , we ll never know if a bit has been flipped (from 0to1or vice versa). If we use 00for0and 01for1, then if the first bit gets flipped we ll know there was an error (because the first bit should never be ), but we won t notice if the second was flipped. If we use 00for0and 11for1, then we will be able to detect an error, as long as at most one bit gets flipped, because flipping one bit of either code word will result in either 01or10, neither of which is a valid code word. Thus, this code allows us to detect an error. It does not allow us to correct an error, because even knowing that a single bit has been flipped, there is no way of knowing whether a 10arose from a 00with the first bit flipped, or from a 11with the second bit flipped. We would need a longer code to be able to correct errors. After our study of coding theory, you should be able to solve problems such as: Given a code, how many errors can be detected? Given a code, how many errors can be corrected? Construct some small codes that allow detection and correction of small numbers of errors. EXERCISE .
