binary negative number is needed. When negative values for the set of whole numbers are INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING included with the set of whole number (which are positi ve), the resulting set is called integer numbers. Integers are non-fractional numbers which have positive and negative values. When learning mathematics , negative numbers are represented using a sign magnitude format, where a number has a sign (positive or negative), and a magnitude (or value). For example - is units (it's magnitude) away from zero in the negative direction (it's sign). Likewise, is units away from zero in a positive direction. Signed magnitude numbers are used in computers, but not for integer values. For now, just realize that it is excessively complex to do arithmetic using signed magnitude numbers. There is a much simpler way to do things called 's complement . This text will u se the term integer and 's complement number interchangeably. Chapter . 's complement operation and 's complement format Many students get confused and somehow believe that a 's complement has something to do with negative numbers, so this section will try to be as explicit here as possible. Realize that if someone asks, "What is a 's complement?", they are actually asking two very different questions. There is a 's complement operation which can be used to negate a number (e. g. translate - - or - - ). There is also a 's complement representation (or format) of numbers which can be used to represent integers, and those integers can be positive and negative whole numbers. To reitera te, the 's complement operation can convert negative numbers to the corresponding positive
