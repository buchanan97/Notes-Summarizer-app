the variance in a population using a sample. We will come back to this in Chapter . Pandas data structures provides methods to compute mean, variance and standard deviation: mean live.prglngth.mean() var live.prglngth.var() std live.prglngth.std() . E ect size For all live births, the mean pregnancy length is weeks, the standard deviation is weeks, which means we should expect deviations of - weeks to be common. Variance of pregnancy length is , which is hard to interpret, especially since the units are weeks2, or square weeks." Variance is useful in some calculations, but it is not a good summary statistic. E ect size Ane ect size is a summary statistic intended to describe (wait for it) the size of an e ect. For example, to describe the di erence between two groups, one obvious choice is the di erence in the means. Mean pregnancy length for rst babies is ; for other babies it is . The di erence is weeks, which works out to hours. As a fraction of the typical pregnancy length, this di erence is about . If we assume this estimate is accurate, such a di erence would have no practical consequences. In fact, without observing a large number of pregnancies, it is unlikely that anyone would notice this di erence at all. Another way to convey the size of the e ect is to compare the di erence between groups to the variability within groups. Cohen's dis a statistic intended to do that; it is de ned d x1 x2 s where x1and x2are the means of the groups and sis the pooled standard deviation". Here's the Python code that computes Cohen's d: def Cohen
