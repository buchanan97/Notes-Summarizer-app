to the label . Algorithms and Data Structures A Global Text . Reducing a task to given primitives: programming motion A program for the robot is a sequence of commands with distinct labels. The labels serve merely to identify the commands and need not be arranged either consecutively or in increasing order. Execution begins with the first command and proceeds to successive commands in the order in which they appear, except when flow of control is redirected by either of the goto commands. Example The following program moves the robot forward until it bumps into a wall: 1if touch goto 2forward 3goto there is no command here; just a label In developing programs for the robot, we feel free to use any high-level language we prefer, and embed robot commands in it. Thus we might have expressed our wall-finding program by the simpler statement while not touch do forward; and then translated it into the robot's language. A program for this robot car to patrol the walls of a city consists of two parts: First, find a wall, the problem we just solved. Second, move along the wall forever while maintaining two conditions: .Never lose touch with the wall; at all times, keep within one step of it. .Visit every spot along the wall in a monotonic progression. The mental image of walking around a room with eyes closed, left arm extended, and the left hand touching the wall at all times will prove useful. To mirror this solution we start the robot so that it has a wall on its immediate left rather than in front. As the robot has no sensor on its left side, we will let
