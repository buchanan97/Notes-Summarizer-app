of this chapter , we will examine the memory hierarchy and its impact on performance. In a sense, with today s high performance microprocessor performing computations so quickly , the task of the high performance programmer becomes the careful management of the memory hierarchy . In some sense it s a useful intellectual exercise to view the simple computations such as addition and multiplication as infinitely fast in order to get the programmer to focus on the impact of memory operations on the overall performance of the program. Registers At least the top layer of the memory hierarchy , the CPU registers, operate as fast as the rest of the processor . The goal is to keep operands in the registers as much as possible. This is especially important for intermediate values used in a long computation such as: X G A W - W M While computing the value of A divided by W , we must store the result of multiplying G by . It would be a shame to have to store this intermediate result in memory and then reload it a few instructions later . On any modern processor with moderate optimization, the intermediate result is stored in a register . Also, the value W is used in two computations, and so it can be loaded once and used twice to eliminate a wasted load. Compilers have been very good at detecting these types of optimizations and ef ficiently making use of the available registers since the 1970s. Adding more registers to the processor has some performance benefit. It s not practical to add enough registers to the processor to store the entire problem data. So
