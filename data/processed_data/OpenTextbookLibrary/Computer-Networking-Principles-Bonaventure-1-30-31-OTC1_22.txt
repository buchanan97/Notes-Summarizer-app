needs, for any reason, to terminate a connection quickly, it can issue a Disconnect.request primitive and to request an abrupt release. The service provider will process the request, stop the two data streams and deliver the Disconnect.indication primitive to the remote user as soon as possible. As illustrated in the gure below, this abrupt connection release may cause losses of SDUs. Source Provider Destination Time DATA.request("A") DATA.request("B") DATA.indication("A") DATA.request("C")Connection opened Connection opened DISCONNECT.req(abrupt) DISCONNECT.indication Figure : Abrupt connection release initiated by a user To ensure a reliable delivery of the SDUs sent by each user over a connection, we need to consider the two streams that compose a connection as independent. A user should be able to release the stream that it uses to send SDUs once it has sent all the SDUs that it planned to send over this connection, but still continue to receive SDUs over the opposite stream. This graceful connection release is usually performed as shown in the gure below. One user issues a Disconnect.request primitive to its provider once it has issued all its Data.request primitives. The service provider will wait until all Data.indication primitives have been delivered to the receiving user before issuing the Disconnnect.indication primitive. This primitive informs the receiving user that it will no longer receive SDUs over this connection, but it is still able to issue Data.request primitives on the stream in the opposite direction. Once the user has issued all of its Data.request primitives, it issues a Disconnnect.request primitive to request the termination of the remaining stream. The service provider will process the request and deliver the corresponding Disconnect.indication to the other user once it has delivered all the pending
