hs, you will almost never need to. I encourage you to think of the DFT as a . Exercises vector of amplitudes and phase o sets that happen to be encoded in the form of complex numbers. To modify a Spectrum, you can access the hsdirectly. For example: spectrum.hs spectrum.hs spectrum.fs cutoff The rst line multiples the elements of hsby , which doubles the amplitudes of all components. The second line sets to only the elements of hswhere the corresponding frequency exceeds some cuto frequency. But Spectrum also provides methods to perform these operations: spectrum.scale( ) spectrum.low pass(cutoff) You can read the documentation of these methods and others at http: greenteapress.com thinkdsp.html . At this point you should have a better idea of how the Signal, Wave, and Spectrum classes work, but I have not explained how the Fast Fourier Transform works. That will take a few more chapters. Exercises Solutions to these exercises are in chap02soln.ipynb . Exercise If you use Jupyter, load chap02.ipynb and try out the examples. You can also view the notebook at http: tinyurl.com thinkdsp02 . Exercise A sawtooth signal has a waveform that ramps up linearly from - to , then drops to - and repeats. See http: en.wikipedia.org wiki Sawtooth wave Write a class called Sawtooth Signal that extends Signal and provides evaluate to evaluate a sawtooth signal. Compute the spectrum of a sawtooth wave. How does the harmonic structure compare to triangle and square waves? Exercise Make a square signal at 1100 Hz and make a wave that samples it at 10000 frames per second. If you plot the spectrum, you can see that most of the harmonics are aliased. When you
