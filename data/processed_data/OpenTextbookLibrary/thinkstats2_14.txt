The result is a Series, yet another pandas data structure. A Series is like a Python list with some additional features. When you print a Series, you get the indices and the corresponding values: pregordr . Variables 13590 13591 13592 Name: pregordr, Length: 13593, dtype: int64 In this example the indices are integers from to 13592, but in general they can be any sortable type. The elements are also integers, but they can be any type. The last line includes the variable name, Series length, and data type; int64 is one of the types provided by Num Py. If you run this example on a -bit machine you might see int32 . You can access the elements of a Series using integer indices and slices: pregordr pregordr : Name: pregordr, dtype: int64 The result of the index operator is an int64 ; the result of the slice is another Series. You can also access the columns of a Data Frame using dot notation: pregordr df.pregordr This notation only works if the column name is a valid Python identi er, so it has to begin with a letter, can't contain spaces, etc. Variables We have already seen two variables in the NSFG dataset, caseid and pregordr , and we have seen that there are variables in total. For the explorations in this book, I use the following variables: caseid is the integer ID of the respondent. Chapter . Exploratory data analysis prglngth is the integer duration of the pregnancy in weeks. outcome is an integer code for the outcome of the pregnancy. The code indicates a live birth. pregordr is a pregnancy serial number; for example, the code for a respondent's
