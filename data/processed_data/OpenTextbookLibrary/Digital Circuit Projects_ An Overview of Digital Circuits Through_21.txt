This book uses colors of wires: red, black, yellow, and green. Red wires are wires which are always expected to carry a positive voltage. Black wires are wires which are always expected to be DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS connected to ground. Yellow wires are used for wires running from the battery towards the output LED. Green wires are used for wires which recycle backwards towards the battery (the use of green wires will become clearer when the latch and counter circuits are implemented). The only reason these colors were chosen is to enhance the readability of the circuits for the text. The standard material for the lab kit only recommends purchasing black wire. The color of the wire is inconsequential to the working of the circuit, though using only black wire means your circuits will appear slightly different from the ones in the text, and be harder to read. Be careful when doing the labs : The exercises in this book require the reader to str ip wire and to use simple logic chips. While a young person could do the exercises in this book, it is intended
