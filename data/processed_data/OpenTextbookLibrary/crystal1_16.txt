1969 revolution 1917 Now if this were a math class, that set of equations would be nonsensical. How could the same variable (revolution) have two contradictory values? But in aprogram, this is perfectly legit: it just means that immediately after the first line of code executes, revolutionhas the value1776, and moments later, after the third line executes, its value has changed to1917. Its value depends entirely on where the program is during its execution. Real (fractional) numbers:float The only odd thing about the second data type in Python is its name. In some other universe it might have been called a real or a decimal or a fractional variable, but for some bizarre historical reasons it is called afloat. All the same rules and regulations pertain tofloats as they do to ints; the only difference is you type a decimal point. So: GPA price of Christian Louboutin shoes interest rate . Note that theinterest ratevariable is indeed afloattype (even though it has no fractional part) because we typed a period: If you re curious, this is because in computer programming parlance a floating-point number means a number where the decimal point might be anywhere. With an integer like - , the decimal point is implicitly at the far right-hand side of the sequence of digits. But with numbers like - or -. or -.000052 or even 520000, the decimal point has floated away from this fixed position. . THE THREE KINDS IN PYTHON19 type(interest rate) float Text:str Speaking of weird names, a Python text variable is of typestr, which stands for string. You could think of it as a bunch of letters strung together like a beaded necklace. Important: when
