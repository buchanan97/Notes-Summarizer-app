of eac h. No w supp ose y ou c ho ose one of the b o wls at random and, without lo oking, select a co okie at random. The co okie is v anilla. What is the probabilit y that it came from Bo wl ? This is a conditional probabilit y; w e w an t p( Bo wl 1j v anilla ) , but it is not ob vious ho w to compute it. If I ask ed a di eren t question the probabilit y of a v anilla co okie giv en Bo wl it w ould b e easy: p( v anillaj Bo wl ) Sadly , p(Aj B) is not the same as p(Bj A) , but there is a w a y to get from one to the other: Ba y es's theorem. Ba y es's theorem A t this p oin t w e ha v e ev erything w e need to deriv e Ba y es's theorem. W e'll start with the observ ation that conjunction is comm utativ e; that is p(Aand B) p(Band A) for an y ev en ts A and B . Next, w e write the probabilit y of a conjunction: p(Aand B) p(A) p(Bj A) Since w e ha v e not said an ything ab out what A and B mean, they are in terc hangeable. In terc hanging them yields p(Band A) p(B) p(Aj B) That's all w e need. Pulling those pieces together, w e get p(B) p(Aj B) p(A) p(Bj A) Based on an example from http: en.wikipedia.org wiki Bayes' theorem that is no longer there. Chapter .
