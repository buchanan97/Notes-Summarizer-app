point value using spaces minimum. The . portion is a precision specifier and in this case indicates digits after the decimal point are to be used. As you can see, this is a very powerful and flexible function! The mirror input function is scanf(). This is similar to Python s input statement. Although you can ask for several values at once, it is generally best to ask for a single value when using this function. It uses the same sort of format specifiers as printf(). There is one important point to note. The scanf() function needs to know where to place the entered value in computer memory. Simply informing it of the name of the variable is insufficient. You must tell it where in memory the variable is, in other words, you Embedded Controllers must specify the address of the variable. C uses the operator to signify address of . For example, if you wish to obtain an integer from the user and place it in a variable called voltage, you might see a program fragment like so printf( Please enter the voltage: ); scanf( d , voltage); It is very common for new programmers to forget the . Be forewarned! Variable Sizes A common question among new programers is Why are there so many sizes of variables available? We have two different sizes of reals; float at bits, and double at bits. We also have three different sizes of intgers at , , and bits each4. In many languages, there s just real and integer with no size variation, so why does C offer so many choices? The reason is that one size doesn t fit all . You
