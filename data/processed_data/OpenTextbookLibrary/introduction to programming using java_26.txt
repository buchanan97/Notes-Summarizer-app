Interpreter for Mac OS Why, you might wonder, use the intermediate Java bytecode at all? Why not just distribute the original Java program and let each person compile it into the machine language of whatever computer they want to run it on? There are several reasons. Fi rst of all, a compiler has to understand Java, a complex high-level language. The compil er is itself a complex program. A Java bytecode interpreter, on the other hand, is a relative ly small, simple program. This makes it easy to write a bytecode interpreter for a new type of computer; once that is done, that computer can run any compiled Java program. It would be m uch harder to write a Java compiler for the same computer. Furthermore, Java was created with the idea that some progra ms would be downloaded over a network. This leads to obvious security concerns: you don t want to download and run a program that will damage your computer or your les. The byte code interpreter acts as a bu er between you and the program you download. You are really runn ing the interpreter, which runs the downloaded program indirectly. The interpreter can pro tect you from potentially dangerous actions on the part of that program. When Javawasstillanewlanguage, itwascriticizedforbein gslow: Since Javabytecodewas executed by an interpreter, it seemed that Java bytecode pro grams could never run as quickly as programs compiled into native machine language (that is, the actual machine language of the computer on which the program is running). However, this pro blem has been largely overcome by the use of just-in-time compilers for executing Java bytecode. A just-in-time compiler translates Java bytecode into
