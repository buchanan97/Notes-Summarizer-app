le with a lot of duplicate lines does not use more memory than what is required for the number of unique lines. . Read the input one line at a time and write each line to the output only if you have already read this line before. (The end result is that you remove the rst occurrence of each line.) Take special care so that a le with a lot of duplicate lines does not use more memory than what is required for the number of unique lines. . Read the entire input one line at a time. Then output all lines sorted by length, with the shortest lines rst. In the case where two lines have the same length, resolve their order using the usual sorted order. Duplicate lines should be printed only once. . Do the same as the previous question except that duplicate lines should be printed the same number of times that they appear in the input. . Read the entire input one line at a time and then output the even numbered lines (starting with the rst line, line ) followed by the odd-numbered lines. Introduction . Read the entire input one line at a time and randomly permute the lines before outputting them. To be clear: You should not modify the contents of any line. Instead, the same collection of lines should be printed, but in a random order. Exercise . ADyck word is a sequence of s and - s with the property that the sum of any pre x of the sequence is never negative. For example, ; ; ; is a Dyck word, but ; ; ; is not a Dyck
