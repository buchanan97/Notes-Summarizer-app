One of the core tools of complexity science is discrete models, including networks and graphs, cellular automatons, and agent-based simulations. These tools are useful in the natural and social sciences, and sometimes in arts and humanities. For an overview of complexity science, see http: thinkcomplex.com complex . Why should you learn about complexity science? Here are a few reasons: Complexity science is useful, especially for explaining why natural and social systems behave the way they do. Since Newton, math-based physics has focused on systems with small numbers of components and simple interactions. These models are e ective for some applications, like celestial mechanics, and less useful for others, like economics. Complexity science provides a diverse and adaptable modeling toolkit. Many of the central results of complexity science are surprising; a recurring theme of this book is that simple models can produce complicated behavior, with
