are called variables is that their value canchangeas the program executes. Although we may initially create anagevariable with the value21, later on in the program the variable s value might change to22, or50, or0. The variable s namenever changes, though. Atomic data types There s one other thing that a variable has in addition to its name and value: atype. In a programming language like Python, every piece of data has a specific type, which is necessary for determining how it behaves and what all you can do to it. A question you should ask yourself a lot is: okay, I ve got a variable in my environment calledx now what is its type? You might have guessed (correctly) that ourageandsloganvariables from the previous section are of different types: one is a number, and the other is a phrase. Inthiscourse, we llprincipallydealwiththreetypesofatomicdata, all of which will be familiar to you. Whole numbers Oneverycommontypeofdataiswholenumbers, orintegers. These areusuallypositive, butcanbenegative, andhavenodecimalpoint. Thingslikeaperson sbirthyear, acandidate svotetotal, orasocial media post s number of likes are represented with this data type. Confusingly, this use of the term environment is different from the term programming environment I introduced on p. . Strictly speaking, although in languages like Java variables indeed have types, in Python thevalueshave types, not the variables. This distinction will never be important for us though. . ATOMIC DATA TYPES15 Real (fractional) numbers You may remember from high school math that the so-called real numbers include not only integers, but also numbers with digits after the decimal point. This type can therefore be used to store interest rates, temperature readings, and average movie ratings on a -to- scale. Since all whole numbers are themselves real
