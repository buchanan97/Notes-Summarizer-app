List of Notation Index Chapter What is Combinatorics? Combinatorics is a subfield of discrete mathematics, so we should begin by asking what discrete mathematics means. The differences are to some extent a matter of opinion, and various mathematicians might classify specific topics differently. Discrete should not be confused with discreet, which is a much more commonly-used word. They share the same Latin root, discretio, which has to do with wise discernment or separation. In the mathematical discrete, the emphasis is on separateness, so discrete is the opposite of continuous. If we are studying objects that can be separated and treated as a (generally countable) collection of units rather than a continuous structure, then this study falls into discrete mathematics. In calculus, we deal with continuous functions, so calculus is not discrete mathematics. In linear algebra, our matrices often have real entries, so linear algebra also does not fall into discrete mathematics. Text books on discrete mathematics often include some
