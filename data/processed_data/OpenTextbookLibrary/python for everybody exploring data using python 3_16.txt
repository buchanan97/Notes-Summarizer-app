language is very simple and frankly very tiresome to write because it is represented all i n zeros and ones: 001010001110100100101010000001111 11100110000011101010010101101101 Machine language seems quite simple on the surface, given that there are only zeros and ones, but its syntax is even more complex and far more intricate than Pytho n. So very few programmers ever write machine language. Instead we build various translators to allow programmers to write in high-level languages like P ython or Java Script and these translators convert the programs to machine language fo r actual execution by the CPU. Since machine language is tied to the computer hardware, machine language is not portable across di erent types of hardware. Programs written in high-level languages can be moved between di erent computers by using a di erent interpreter on the new machine or recompiling the code to create a machine language version of the program for the new machine. These programming language translators fall into two general categories: ( ) interpreters and ( ) compilers. Aninterpreter reads the source code of the program as written by the programmer, parses the source code, and interprets the instructions on the y. Python is an interpreter and when we are running Python interactively, we can type a line of Python (a sentence) and Python processes it immediately and is ready for us to type another line of Python. Some of the lines of Python tell Python that you want it to remember some val ue for later. We need to pick a name for that value to be remembered and we can use that symbolic name to retrieve the value later. We use the term variable to refer
