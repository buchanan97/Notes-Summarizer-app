this type of semester, I do not cover the digital components in this book as a single entity. Chapters , , and are assigned the f irst week, and each subsequent chapter assigned each subsequent week. A short overview of each circuit is provided in class, but the students are largely left on their own to do the problems associated with the circuit. By the eighth week, all of the cir cuits have been covered and the students are ready to begin studying the data path of the CPU. The digital circuits that have been covered in this text form the basis for the components in the CPU. A sample -week schedule follows. Note that the assignments from this text are the second topic in each week. The first assignment each week represent material used in covering Computer Organization using a MIPS programming text.
