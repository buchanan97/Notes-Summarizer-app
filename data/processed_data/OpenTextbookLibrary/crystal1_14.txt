atomic level, we ll really only ever need to deal with the three types of this section. The three kinds in Python Now the three kinds of atomic data described above arelanguagegeneral: this means that they re conceptual, not tied to any specific programming language or analysis tool.Anytechnology used for Data Science will have the ability to deal with those three basic types. The specific ways they do so will differ somewhat from language to language. Let s learn about how Python implements them. Whole numbers:int One of the most basic Python data types is the int, which stands for integer. It s what we use to represent whole numbers. In Python, you create a variable by simply typing its name, an equals sign, and then its initial value, like so: revolution 1776 This is our firstline of code3. As we ll see, lines of code are executedone by one there is a time before, and a time after, each line is actually carried out. This will turn out to be very important. (Oh, and a line of code is sometimes also called a statement.) Python variable names can be as long as you like, provided they consist only of upper and lower case letters, digits, and underscores. (You do have to be consistent with your capitalization and your By the way, the wordcodeis grammatically a mass noun, not a count noun. Hence it is proper to say I wrote some code last night, not I wrote some codes last night. If you misuse this, it will brand you as a newbie right away. .
