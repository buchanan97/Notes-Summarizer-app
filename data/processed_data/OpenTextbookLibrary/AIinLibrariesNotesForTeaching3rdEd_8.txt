program was making some poor or inaccurate diagnoses. Usually, this tuning would consist of the programmers re-writing or changing the program, not of the program modifying itself by learning. So, in general, these programs themselves did not pay a lot of attention to data that arose after they were written. This style of approach is AI by expert system . Nowadays ML would approach diagnoses entirely differently. There would be a blank slate program that could take in vast amounts of data, data about different patients, and their many and varied properties, qualities, and features , data about the images, and their properties, and so on. The program would be set up to focus on the label which identified whether a patient had cancer or not. Then there would be a training set, which would be data about existing patients, and even members of the public, and known data as to whether they had cancer. The program would learn which features were associated, or correlated, with (the label of) cancer and which not. It would be able to predict which members of the training set had cancer (hopefully with a good degree of accuracy). Then, given success, the program would be released in the world at large and applied to a test set or test cases i.e. real cases where the diagnoses are not known. (And, possibly, results for real cases will be added through time to the training set to improve performance yet further although care would be needed were this to be attempted.) You can see how in some ways this differs from diagnoses by medical doctors and consultants or by expert system. The consultants will have had
