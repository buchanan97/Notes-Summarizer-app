tinue to believe that Open GL makes a good introduction to this material. Chapter is a short overview of computer graphics. It introduces many concepts that will be covered in much more detail in the rest of the book. Chapter covers two-dimensional graphics in Java, Java Script, and S VG, with an emphasis on ideas such as transformations and scene graphs that carry over to three dimensions. Chapter and Chapter cover Openg GL . While Open GL is fairly primitive by Preface x today sstandard, itincludesmanybasicfeaturesthatares tillfundamentaltothree-dimensional computer graphics. Only part of the API is covered. Chapter coversthree.js, a higher-level object-oriented D graphics API for Web gra phics using Java Script. This chapter shows how fundamental conce pts can be used in a higher-level interface. Chapter and Chapter cover Web GL, a modern version of Open GL for graphics on the Web. Web GL is very low-level, and it requires the programmer to write shader programs to implement many features that are built into Open GL . Look ing at the implementation is an opportunity to understand more deeply how computers actual ly make D images. Chapter looks very brie y at some advanced techniques that are not po ssible in Open GL. And Chapter is an introduction to Web GPU, the newest API for graphics on t he Web. Appendix A containsbriefintroductionstothreeprogramminglanguag esthatareusedinthe book: Java, C, and Java Script. Appendix B is meant to get readers started with the most basic uses of Blender, a sophisticated D modeling program. I have found that introducing students to Blender is a good way to help them develop their three-dime nsional intuition. Appendix C contains even briefer introductions to two D graphics
