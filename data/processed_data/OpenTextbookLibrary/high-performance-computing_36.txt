However , if we are doing -bit non-unit- stride loads and have the capability to bypass cache, each load will be satisfied from one of the four SIMMs in ns. While that SIMM refreshed, another load can occur from any of the other three SIMMs in ns. In a random mix of non-unit loads there is a chance that the next load will fall on a fresh DRAM. If the load falls on a bank while it is refreshing, it simply has to wait until the refresh completes. By the way , most machines have uncached memory spaces for process synchronization and I O device registers. However , memory references to these locations bypass the cache because of the address chosen, not necessarily because of the instruction chosen. A further advantage of bypassing cache is that the data do
