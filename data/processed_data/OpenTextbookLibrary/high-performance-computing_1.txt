Assembly Language Introduction to the Connexions Edition This provides an introduction to the Connexions republished version of the book. Introduction to the Connexions Edition The purpose of this book has always been to teach new programmers and scientists about the basics of High Performance Computing. T oo many parallel and high performance computing books focus on the architecture, theory and computer science surrounding HPC. I wanted this book to speak to the practicing Chemistry student, Physicist, or Biologist who need to write and run their programs as part of their research. I was using the first edition of the book written by Kevin Dowd in 1996 when I found out that the book was going out of print. I immediately sent an angry letter to O'Reilly customer support imploring them to keep the book going as it was the only book of its kind in the marketplace. That complaint letter
