pis the probability of rewiring an edge. The forloop enumerates the edges and uses flip (de ned in Section ) to choose which ones get rewired. If we are rewiring an edge from node uto node v, we have to choose a replacement for v, called new v . Clustering . To compute the possible choices, we start with nodes , which is a set, and subtract o uand its neighbors, which avoids self loops and multiple edges. . To choose new v , we use the Num Py function choice , which is in the module random . . Then we remove the existing edge from utov, and . Add a new edge from utonew v . As an aside, the expression G u returns a dictionary that contains the neighbors of uas keys. It is usually faster than using G.neighbors (see http: thinkcomplex.com neigh ). This function does not consider the edges in the order speci ed by Watts and Strogatz, but that doesn't seem to a ect the results. Figure shows WS graphs with n ,k , and a range of values of p. Whenp , the graph is a ring lattice. When p , it is completely random. As we'll see, the interesting things happen in between. Clustering The next step is to compute the clustering coe cient, which quanti es the tendency for the nodes to form cliques. A clique is a set of nodes that are completely connected; that is, there are edges between all pairs of node
