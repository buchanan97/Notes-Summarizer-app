circuits as simple as possible for novices who have little support in implementing these labs. The labs assume no institutional infrastructure or support. No lab space or extra equipment should be needed, and students should be able to complete these labs at home with only the equipment listed in chapter . Second the book is written to address the interests and needs of both the hobbyist and CS students. Both groups have similar but somewhat different lev els of interests and the text attempts to address the needs of both groups. How the text supports these two groups is explained in the next two sections. I. Easy to understand circuit design and implementation One important characteristic of the target readers for this book is that they will have little or no face- -face support when implementing the components. Thus the book is written to help maximize the chance for success in implementing the circuits in each chapter. To do this the book does the following: ) All parts that are needed for all circuits are listed, and can be easily obtained from a number of online sources. There is no need to start a project and reach a point where some extra part is needed. ) An attempt was made to keep the kits as low cost as possible. This text is free for download. When the text was written, a complete lab kit (without tools) could be ordered as parts for - , with - extra if wire strippers or pliers are not available. This is a reasonable cost considering many textbooks today can sell for or more. ) Even simple steps, such as how to strip wires, are
