it turn left at every step to sense the wall with its front bumper, then turn right to resume its position with the wall to its left. Wall-following algorithm described informally Idea of solution: Touch the wall with your left hand; move forward, turning left or right as required to keep touching the wall. Wall-following algorithm described in English: Clockwise, starting at left, look for the first direction not blocked by a wall, and if found, take a step in that direction. Let us test this algorithm on some critical configurations. The robot inside a unit square turns forever, never finding a direction to take a step ( Exhibit ). In Exhibit the robot negotiates a left-hand spike. After each step, there is a wall to its left-rear. In Exhibit the robot enters a blind alley. At the end of the alley, it turns clockwise twice, then exits by the route it entered. Exhibit : Robot in a box spins on its heels.

Algorithm specified in a high-level language The ideas presented informally in above section are made precise in the following elegant, concise program: wall to left-rear loop wall to left-rear left; wall to left-front while touch do wall to right-front right; wall to left-front endwhile; wall to left-front forward; wall to left-rear forever; wall to left-rear Program verification. The comments in braces are program invariants: Assertions about the state of the robot that are true every time the flow of control reaches the place in the program where they are written. We
