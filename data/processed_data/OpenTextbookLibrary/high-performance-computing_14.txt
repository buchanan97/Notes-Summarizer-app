layout and the external pins on the chip that communicate the address and data information between the memory and the processor . Access T ime The amount of time it takes to read or write a memory location is called the memory access time . A related quantity is the memory cycle time . Whereas the access time says how quickly you can reference a memory location, cycle time describes how often you can repeat references. They sound like the same thing, but they re not. For instance, if you ask for data from DRAM chips with a -ns access time, it may be ns before you can ask for more data from the same chips. This is because the chips must internally recover from the previous access. Also, when you are retrieving data sequentially from DRAM chips, some technologies have improved performance. On these chips, data immediately following the previously accessed data may be accessed as quickly as ns. Access and cycle times for commodity DRAMs are shorter than they were just a few years ago, meaning that it is possible to build faster memory systems. But CPU clock speeds have increased too. The home computer market makes a good study . In the early 1980s, the access time of commodity DRAM ( ns) was shorter than the clock cycle ( MHz ns) of the IBM PC XT . This meant that DRAM could be connected directly to the CPU without worrying about over running the memory system. Faster XT and A T models were introduced in the mid-1980s with CPUs that clocked more quickly than the access times of available commodity memory . Faster memory was available for
