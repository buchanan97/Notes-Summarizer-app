part of the 's complement represen tation. Chapter . The 's Complement (or Integer) Type Because the 's complement operation negates a number, many people believe that a 's complement number is negative. A better way to think about a ' s complement number is that is a type. A type is an abstraction which has a range of values, and a set of operations. For a 's complement type, the range of values is all positive and negative whole numbers. For operations, it has the normal arithmetic operations such as addition ( ), subtraction ( -), multiplication ( ) , and division ( ). A type also needs an internal representation. In mathematics classes, numbers were always abstract, theoretical entities, and assumed to be infinite. But a comput er is not an abstract entity, it is a physical implementation of a computing machine. Therefore, all numbers in a computer must have a physical size for their internal representation. For integers, this size is often (byte) , (short) , (integer) , or (long) bits, though larger numbers of bits can be used to store the numbers . Because the left most bit must be a for positive, and for negative, using a fixed size also helps to identify easily if the number is positive or negative. INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING Because the r ange of the integer values is constrained to the 2n values (where n is the size of the integer) that can be represented with 's complement, about half of which are positive and half are negative, roughly 2n- values of magnitude are possible. However, one value, zero, must be accounted for, so there are
