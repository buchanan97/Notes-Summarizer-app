Visitors The above methods are suf cient for many common tasks, but application developers may nd that they need to perform more sophisticated operations on directory trees. The visitor protocol is very simple. A visitor needs to implement visit File: and visit Directory: . The actual traversal of the lesystem is handled by a guide. A guide works with a visitor, crawling the lesystem and notifying the visitor of the les and directories it discovers. There are three Guide classes, Preorder Guide ,Postorder Guide and Breadth First Guide , which traverse the lesystem in different orders. To arrange for a guide to traverse the lesystem with a particular visitor is simple. Here s an example: Breadth First Guide show: a Reference to: a Visitor The enumeration methods described above are implemented with visitors; see Copy Visitor ,Delete Visitor , and Collect Visitor for examples. Chapter summary File System is a powerful and elegant library to manipulate les. It is a fundamental part of Pharo. The Pharo community will continue to extend and build it. The class File Reference is the most important entry point to the framework. File System offers factory class methods to build le systems on hard disk and in memory. File Reference is a central class in the framework which represents a le or a folder. A le reference offers methods to operate on a le and navigate within a le system. Sending the message as File Reference to a string
