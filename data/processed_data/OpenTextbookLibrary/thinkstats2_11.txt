data from Cycle , which was conducted from January 2002 to March 2003. The goal of the survey is to draw conclusions about a population ; the target population of the NSFG is people in the United States aged - . Ideally surveys would collect data from every member of the population, but that's seldom possible. Instead we collect data from a subset of the Chapter . Exploratory data analysis population called a sample . The people who participate in a survey are called respondents . In general, cross-sectional studies are meant to be representative , which means that every member of the target population has an equal chance of participating. That ideal is hard to achieve in practice, but people who conduct surveys come as close as they can. The NSFG is not representative; instead it is deliberately oversampled . The designers of the study recruited three groups Hispanics, African-Americans and teenagers at rates higher than their representation in the U.S. population, in order to make sure that the number of respondents in each of these groups is large enough to draw valid statistical inferences. Of course, the drawback of oversampling is that it is not as easy to draw conclusions about the general population based on statistics from the survey. We will come back to this point later. When working with this kind of data, it is important to be familiar with thecodebook , which documents the design of the study, the survey questions, and the encoding of the responses.
