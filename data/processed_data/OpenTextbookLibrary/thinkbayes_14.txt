F or example, if I toss t w o coins, and A means the rst coin lands face up, and B means the second coin lands face up, then p(A) p(B) : , and sure enough, p(Aand B) p(A) p(B) : . But this form ula only w orks b ecause in this case A and B are indep enden t; that is, kno wing the outcome of the rst ev en t do es not c hange the probabilit y of the second. Or, more formally , p(Bj A) p(B) . Here is a di eren t example where the ev en ts are not indep enden t. Supp ose that A means that it rains to da y and B means that it rains tomorro w. If I kno w that it rained to da y , it is more lik ely that it will rain tomorro w, so p(Bj A) p(B) . In general, the probabilit y of a conjunction is p(Aand B) p(A) p(Bj A) for an y A and B . So if the c hance of rain on an y giv en da y is , the c hance of rain on t w o consecutiv e da ys is not , but probably a bit higher. . The co okie problem The co okie problem W e'll get to Ba y es's theorem so on, but I w an t to motiv ate it with an example called the co okie problem. Supp ose there are t w o b o wls of co okies.
