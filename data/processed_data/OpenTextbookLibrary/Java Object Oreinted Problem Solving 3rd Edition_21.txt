code is known as a translator (Fig. ). Thus, with suitable translation software for Java or C we can write programs as if the computer could understand Java or C directly. Source code translators come in two varieties. An interpreter translates a single line of source code directly into machine language and executes the code before going on to the next line of source code. A compiler translates the entire source code program into executable object code, which means that the object code can then be run directly without further translation. There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. Interpreted programs generally run less ef ciently than compiled programs, SECTION Why Java? High-level language Translator software Machine language Source code Object code(a b) 2000110101 101000110 101000110 Figure : Translator software translates high-level source code to machine language object code . because they must translate and execute each line of the program before proceeding to the next line. If a line of code is repeated, an interpreter would have to translate the line each time it is encountered. By contrast, once compiled, an object program is just executed without any need for further translation. It is also much easier to re ne compiled code to make it run more ef ciently. But interpreters are generally quicker and easier to develop and provide somewhat better error messages when things go wrong. Some languages that you may have heard of, such as BASIC, LISP , and Perl, are mostly used in interpreted form, although compilers are also available for these languages. Programs written in COBOL, FORTRAN, C, C , and Pascal are compiled. As we will see in the next section, Java programs
