ASCII should be noted. All digits start with binary digits 0011 0000. Thus is 0x0011 0000, is 00011 0000, etc. To convert a numeric char acter digit to a number it is only necessary to subtract the character value of . For example, ' ' - ' ' , ' ' - ' ' , etc. This is the basis for an easy algorithm to convert numeric strings to numbers which will be discussed in the problems. By now it is hoped that the reader is convinced that hexadecimal is a generally preferred way to represent data in a computer. The decimal value for this string would be , , , and the binary would be 0100 1111 0110 1110 0110 0011 0010 0101. Having taught for many year, however, I know old habits die hard with many students who will struggle endlessly converting to decimal to avoid learning hex. INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING Also note that all ASCII upper case letters start with the binary string 0010 0000, and are offset for each new character. So A is 0001, B is 0100 0010, etc. Lower case letters start with the binary strin g 0110 and are offset by for each new character, so a is 0110 0001, b is 0110 0010, etc. Therefore, all upper case letter s differ from their lower case counterpart by a in the digit 0100. This relations hip between lower case and capital letters will be use to illustrate logical operations later in this chapter. Chapter .
