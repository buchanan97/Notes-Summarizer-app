send information to the computer screen. printf() is a very large and complicated function with many possible variants of format specifiers. Format specifiers are the things used as placeholders for values. Some examples are: ffloat lfdouble (long float) efloat using exponent notation gfloat using shorter of e or f style ddecimal integer lddecimal long integer xhexadecimal (hex or base ) integer ooctal (base ) integer uunsigned integer csingle character scharacter string Figure , print format types Suppose that you wanted to print out the value of the variable ans in decimal, hex, and octal. The following instruction would do it all: printf( The answer is d, or hex x, or octal o. n , ans, ans, ans ); Note how the three variables are labeled. This is important. If you printed something in hex without some form of label, you might not know if it was hex or decimal. For example, if you just saw the number , how would you know it s decimal or hex ( decimal)? For that matter, how would you set a hex constant in your C code? The compiler would have no way of knowing either. To get around this, hex values are prefixed with 0x. Thus, we have 0x23 for hex . The printf() function does not automatically add the 0x on output. The reason is because it may prove distracting if you have a table filled only with hex values. It s easy enough to use 0x d instead of just d for the output format. You can also add a field width specifier. For example, 5d means print the integer in decimal with spaces minimum. Similarly, .2f means print the floating
