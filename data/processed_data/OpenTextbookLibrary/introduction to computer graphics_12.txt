of the elect ron beam. (For a color screen, each pixel had a red dot, a green dot, and a blue dot, which were separately illuminated by the beam.) A modern at-screen computer monitor is not a raster in the sa me sense. There is no moving electron beam. The mechanism that controls the color s of the pixels is di erent for di erent types of screen. But the screen is still made up of pi xels, and the color values for all the pixels are still stored in a frame bu er. The idea of an ima ge consisting of a grid of pixels, with numerical color values for each pixel, de nes raster gr aphics. Although images on the computer screen are represented usin g pixels, specifying individual pixel colors is not always the best way to create an image. Ano ther way is to specify the basic geometric objects that it contains, shapes such as lines, ci rcles, triangles, and rectangles. This is the idea that de nes vector graphics : Represent an image as a list of the geometric shapes that it contains. To make things more interesting, the shape s can have attributes , such as the thickness of a line or the color that lls a rectangle. Of c ourse, not every image can be composed from simple geometric shapes. This approach certa inly wouldn t work for a picture of a beautiful sunset (or for most any other photographic ima ge). However, it works well for many types of images, such as architectural blueprints and s cienti c illustrations.
