more named boxes: avg num impressions board name "Things to Make" I m deliberately shuffling around the order of the boxes just to mess with you. Python makes no guarantee of what order it will store variables in anyway, and in reality it actually does become a big jumbled mess like this under the hood. All Python guarantees is One other tiny detail you might notice: even though our code had single quotes to delimit Bekka Palmer s name, I put double quotes in the box in the memory picture. This is to emphasize that no matter how you create a string in the code whether with single quotes or double the underlying thing that gets written to memory is the same. In fact, what s stored are actually the characters Bekka Palmerwithoutthe quotes. I like putting quotes in the memory pictures, though, just to emphasize the string nature of the value. CHAPTER . MEMORY PICTURES that it will consistently store a name, value, and a type for each variable. When we change the value of a variable (rather than creating a new one), the value in the appropriate box gets updated: avg num impressions pin count another board 'Pink!' Note carefully thatthe previous value in the box is completely obliteratedand there is absolutely no way to ever get it back. There s no way, in fact, to know that there evenwasa previous value different than the current one. Unless specifically orchestrated to do so, computer programs only keep track of the present, not the past. One other thing: unlike in some programming languages (so-called strongly typed languages like Java or C ) even thetypeof value that a variable holds
