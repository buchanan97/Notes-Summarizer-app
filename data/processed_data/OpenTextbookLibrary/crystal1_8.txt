To be responsibledatascientists, though, we regoingtodothe Spiderman thing and be up front and transparent about exactly what we ve found, and what we might be missing. Believe me, this will make you powerful enough! Chapter A trip to Jupyter Python is a ridiculously popularlanguagefor programming and data science (currently the third most widely used in the world1) which is one of many reasons we re using it for this course. The language itself is different from theprogramming environment usedtowritecodeinit, justas English isdifferentfrom Microsoft Word and Google Docs. A programming environment is just a fancy name for a tool or application used to write programs. At a minimum, it must include a way toedit(write and revise) code, and a way toexecute(run) it. Therearemanydifferentprogrammingenvironmentsdatascientists use to write Python code, just as there are many different word processing apps people use to write English. The choice largely comes down to personal preference. Some use full-blown IDEs ( integrateddevelopmentenvironments )like Spyderor Atom; some use text-based tools like Notepad orvim. In this class, we re going to use the friendly and minimalistic Jupyter Notebooks environment since it s appropriate for an intro experience. Jupyter Notebooks The concept of a Jupyter Notebook is simple: it s a Web page with editable cells. Each cell is a little text window you can type in. Seehttps: www.tiobe.com tiobe-index . CHAPTER . A TRIP TO JUPYTER There are three kinds of cells in Jupyter Notebooks: Raw. Raw is dumb. Never
