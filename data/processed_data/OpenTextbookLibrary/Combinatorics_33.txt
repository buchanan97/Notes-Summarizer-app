EXERCISES . )There are 8buses a day from Toronto to Ottawa, 20from Ottawa to Montreal, and buses directly from Toronto to Montreal. Assuming that you do not have to complete the trip in one day (so the departure and arrival times of the buses is not an issue), how many different schedules could you use in travelling by bus from Toronto to Montreal? )How many -bit ternary strings (that is, strings whose only entries are , , or2) begin with either 1or01? . Summing up Very likely you ve used the sum rule or the product rule when counting simple things, without even stopping to think about what you were doing. The reason we re going through each of them very slowly and carefully, is because when we start looking at more complicated problems, our uses of the sum and product rules will become more subtle. If we don t have a very clear understanding in very simple situations of what we are doing and why, we ll be completely lost when we get to more di icult examples. It s dangerous to try to come up with a simple guideline for when to use the product rule and when to use the sum rule, because such a guideline will often go wrong in complicated situations. Nonetheless, a good question to ask yourself when you are trying to decide which rule to use is, Would I describe
