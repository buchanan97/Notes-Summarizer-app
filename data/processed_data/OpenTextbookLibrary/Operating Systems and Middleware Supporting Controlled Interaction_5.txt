the students' exibility. It also allows a more comprehensive array of concepts to be concretely illustrated, as the systems embody fundamentally di erent approaches to some problems, such as the scheduling of processors' time and the tracking of les' disk space. Most of the examples are drawn from the stable core portions of the operating systems and, as such, are equally applicable to a range of speci c versions. Whenever Microsoft Windows is mentioned without further speci cation, the material should apply to Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 2008, Windows , Windows , Windows 2012, and Windows . All Linux examples are from version , though much of the material applies to other versions as well. Wherever actual Linux source code is shown (or whenever ne details matter for other reasons), the speci c subversion of is mentioned in the end-of-chapter notes. Most of the Mac OS X examples originated with version , also known as Tiger, but should be applicable to other versions. PREFACE xiii Where the book discusses the protection of each process's memory, one additional operating system is brought into the mix of examples, in order to illustrate a more comprehensive range of alternative designs. The IBM i Series, formerly known as the AS , embodies an interesting approach to protection that might see wider application within current students' lifetimes. Rather than giving each process its own address space (as Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X do), the i Series allows all processes to share a single address space and to hold varying access permissions to individual objects within that space. Several middleware systems are used for examples as well.
