supportive evidence from experiments doesn t prove your hypothesis in a logical sense. It only means that you have failed to disprove your hypothesis. However, many people still believe that science can prove things in an absolute way. It . MODELS IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING can t. There is no logical way for us to reach the ground truth of nature1. This means that all the laws of nature, including those listed previously, are no more than well-tested hypotheses at best. Scientists have repeatedly failed to disprove them, so we give them more credibility than we do to other hypotheses. But there is absolutely no guarantee of their universal, permanent correctness. There is always room for other alternative theories to better explain nature. In this sense, all science can do is just build models of nature. All of the laws of nature mentioned earlier are also models, not scienti c facts, strictly speaking. This is something every single person working on scienti c research should always keep in mind. I have used the word model many times already in this book without giving it a de nition. So here is an informal de nition: Amodel is a simpli ed representation of a system. It can be conceptual, verbal, diagrammatic, physical, or formal (mathematical). As a cognitive entity interacting with the external world, you are always creating a model of something in your mind. For example, at this very moment as you are reading this textbook, you are probably creating a model of what is written in this book.
