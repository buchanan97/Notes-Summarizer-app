Data.request primitive issued by the other endpoint. The message-mode transfer is illustrated in the gure below. The main advantage of the message-transfer mode is that the recipient receives exactly the SDUs that were sent by the other user. If each SDU contains a command, the receiving user can process each command as soon as it receives a SDU. Unfortunately, the message-mode transfer is not widely used on the Internet. On the Internet, the most popular connection-oriented service transfers SDUs in stream-mode. With the stream-mode, the service provider supplies a byte stream that links the two communicating users. The sending user sends bytes by using Data.request primitives that contain sequences of bytes as SDUs. The service provider delivers SDUs containing consecutive bytes to the receiving user by using Data.indication primitives. The service provider ensures that all the bytes sent at one end .

However, the service provider does not attempt to preserve the boundaries of the SDUs. There is no relation enforced by the service provider between the number of Data.request and the number of Data.indication primitives. The stream-mode is illustrated in the gure below. In practice, a consequence of the utilisation of the stream-mode is that if the users want to exchange structured SDUs, they will need to provide the mechanisms that allow the receiving user to separate successive SDUs in the byte stream
