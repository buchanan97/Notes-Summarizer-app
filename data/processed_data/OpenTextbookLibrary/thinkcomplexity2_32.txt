the following steps: . We'll start by constructing a ring lattice, which is a kind of regular graph. . Then we'll rewire it as Watts and Strogatz did. Chapter Small World Graphs Figure : A ring lattice with n andk . . We'll write a function to measure the degree of clustering and use a Network X function to compute path lengths. . Then we'll compute the degree of clustering and path length for a range of values of p. . Finally, I'll present Dijkstra's algorithm, which computes shortest paths e ciently. Ring lattice Aregular graph is a graph where each node has the same number of neighbors; the number of neighbors is also called the degree of the node. A ring lattice is a kind of regular graph, which Watts and Strogatz use as the basis of their model. In a ring lattice with nnodes, the nodes can be arranged in a circle with each node connected to the knearest neighbors. For example, a ring lattice with n andk would contain the following edges: ( ; ), ( ; ), and ( ; ). Notice that the edges wrap around" from the highest-numbered node back to . More generally, we can enumerate the edges like this: Ring lattice def adjacent edges(nodes, halfk): n len(nodes) for i, u in enumerate(nodes): for j in range(i , i halfk ): v nodes j n yield u, v adjacent edges takes a list of nodes and a parameter, halfk , which is half ofk. It is a generator function that yields one edge at a time. It uses the modulus operator, , to wrap around from the highest-numbered node to the lowest. We
