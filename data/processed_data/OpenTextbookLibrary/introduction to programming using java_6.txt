Ihavetriedtouseaconversational writing style that might be closer to classroom lecture than to a typical textbook. This is certainly not a Java reference book, and it is not a comprehen sive survey of all the features of Java. It is not written as a quick introduction to Java for p eople who already know another programming language. Instead, it is directed main ly towards people who are learning programming for the rst time, and it is as much about general programming concepts as it is about Java in particular. I believe that Introduction to Programming using Java is fully competitive with the conventionally published, prin ted programming textbooks that are available on the market. (Well, all right, I ll confess that I think it s better.) There are several approaches to teaching Java. One approach uses graphical user interface programming from the very beginning. And some people believ e that object oriented programmingshouldbeemphasizedfromtheverybeginning. T hesearenottheapproachthat I take. The approach that I favor starts with the more basic bui lding blocks of programming and builds from there. After an introductory chapter, I cover pr ocedural programming in Chapters , , and . Object-oriented programming is introduced in Ch apter . Chapter covers the closely related topic of event-oriented programming and gr aphical user interfaces. Arrays are introduced in Chapter with a full treatment in Chapter . Ch apter is a short chapter that marks a turning point in the book, moving beyond the fundamen tal ideas of programming to cover
