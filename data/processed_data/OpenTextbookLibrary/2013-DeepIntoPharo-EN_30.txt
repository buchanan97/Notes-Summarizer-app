IP style network name lookup and translation facilities. Script provides two examples of socket address creation. The rst one creates an address from a string describing the server name ( 'www.esug.org' ), while the second does the creation from a string representing the IP address of the server ( ' ' ). Note that to use the Net Name Resolver you need to have your machine connected to a network with a DNS2, which is likely the case. The only exception is for retrieving the local host address, i.e. Domain Name System : basically a directory that maps device names to their IP address. Sockets which is the generic address to refer to the machine that runs your software (Pharo here). Script : Creating a Socket Address esug Address local Address esug Address : Net Name Resolver address For Name: 'www.esug.org'. local Address : Net Name Resolver address For Name: ' '. Now we can connect our TCP socket to the server as shown in Script . Message connect To:port: attempts to connect the socket to the server using the server address and port provided as parameters. The server address refers to the address of the network interface (e.g. ethernet, wi ) used by the server. The port refers to the communication endpoint on the network interface. Each network interface has for each IP transport protocol (e.g. TCP , UDP) a collection of ports that are numbered from to 65535. For a given protocol, a port number on an interface can only be used by a single process.
