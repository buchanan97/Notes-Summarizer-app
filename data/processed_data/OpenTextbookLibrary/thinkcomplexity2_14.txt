structure, are moving toward devolved command and control. Analysis!computation In classical engineering, the space of feasible designs is limited by our capability for analysis. For example, designing the Ei el Tower was possible because Gustave Ei el developed novel analytic techniques, in particular for dealing with wind load. Now tools for computer-aided design and analysis make it possible to build almost anything that can be imagined. Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is my favorite example. Isolation!interaction In classical engineering, the complexity of large systems is managed by isolating components and minimizing interactions. This is still an important engineering principle; nevertheless, the availability of computation makes it increasingly feasible to design systems with complex interactions between components. Design!search Engineering is sometimes described as a search for solutions in a landscape of possible designs. Increasingly, the search process Chapter Complexity Science can be automated. For example, genetic algorithms explore large design spaces and discover solutions human engineers would not imagine (or like). The ultimate genetic algorithm, evolution, notoriously generates designs that violate the rules of human engineering. Complexity thinking We are getting farther a eld now, but the shifts I am postulating in the criteria of scienti c modeling are related to 20th century developments in logic and epistemology. Aristotelian logic !many-valued logic In traditional logic, any proposition is either true or false. This system lends itself to math-like proofs, but fails (in dramatic ways) for many real-world applications. Alternatives include many-valued logic, fuzzy logic, and other systems designed to handle indeterminacy, vagueness, and uncertainty. Bart Kosko discusses some of these systems in Fuzzy Thinking . Frequentist probability !Bayesianism Bayesian probability has been around for centuries, but was not widely used until
