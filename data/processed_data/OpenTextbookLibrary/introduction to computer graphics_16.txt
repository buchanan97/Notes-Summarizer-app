of graphics le formats. There are many ways to represent an image as data sto red in a le. If the original image is to be recovered from the bits stored in the le, the re presentation must follow some exact, known speci cation. Such a speci cation is called a g raphics le format. Some popular graphics le formats include GIF, PNG, JPEG, Web P, and SVG. M ost images used on the Web are GIF, PNG, or JPEG, but most browsers also have support for SVG images and for the newer Web P format. GIF, PNG, JPEG, and Web P are basically raster graphics forma ts; an image is speci ed by storing a color value for each pixel. GIF is an older le for mat, which has largely been superseded by PNG, but you can still nd GIF images on the web. (The GIF format supports animated images, so GIFs are often used for simple animation s on Web pages.) GIF uses an indexed color model with a maximum of colors. PNG can use e ither indexed or full -bit color, while JPEG is meant for full color images. The amount of data necessary to represent a raster image can b e quite large. However, the data usually contains a lot of redundancy, and the data ca n be compressed to reduce its CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION size. GIF and PNG use lossless data compression , which means that the original image can be recovered perfectly from the compressed data. JPEG us es alossy data compression algorithm, which means that the image that is recovered from a JPEG le is not exactly the same as the original image;
