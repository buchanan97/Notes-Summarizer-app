error message like this: File: Hello.java line: Error:';'expected That s pretty good: the location of the error is correct, and the error message tells you what s wrong. But error messages are not always easy to understand. Sometimes the compiler reports the place in the program where the error was Chapter Variables and Operators detected, not where it actually occurred. And sometimes the description of the problem is more confusing than helpful. For example, if you forget the closing brace at the end ofmain(line ), you might get a message like this: File: Hello.java line: Error: reached end of file while parsing There are two problems here. First, the error message is written from the compiler s point of view, not yours.Parsingis the process of reading a program before translating; if the compiler gets to the end of the file while still parsing, that means something was omitted. But the compiler doesn t know what. It also doesn t know where. The compiler discovers the error at the end of the program (line ), but the missing brace should be on the previous line. Error messages contain useful information, so you should make an effort to read and understand them. But don t take them too literally. During the first few weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax and other compile-time errors. As you gain experience, you will make fewer mistakes and find them more quickly. Other Types of Errors The second type of error is arun-time error, so-called because it does not appear until after the program has started running. In Java, these errors occur while the interpreter is executing
