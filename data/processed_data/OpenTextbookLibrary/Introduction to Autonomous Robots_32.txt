Calculate the Cartesian Do Fs of a standard car. How is it possible to still reach every point on the plane? . A steering wheel allows you to change the yaw of your car. Can you also change its pitch and its roll? See Figure for reference. Chapter Kinematics In order to plan a robot s movements, we have to understand the relationship between our control variables (i.e. the input to the motors that we can control at any given time) and the effect of these control variables on the motion of the robot. The simplest models of such relationships can be built by looking at the geometry of our robot, known as the field of kinematics. For simple arms in static configurations, a kinematic model is rather straightforward: if we know the generalized position configuration angle of each joint, we can calculate the generalized position of its end-effectors using trigonometry a process known as forward kinematics . This process is usually more involved for mobile robots, as the speeds of the wheels need to be integrated to determine changes in robot pose, which we refer
