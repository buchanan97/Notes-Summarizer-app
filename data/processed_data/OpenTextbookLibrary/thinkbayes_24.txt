answ er is, in fact, correct. T o start, w e should mak e a careful statemen t of the data. In this case D consists of t w o parts: Mon t y c ho oses Do or B and there is no car there. . The Mon t y Hall problem Next w e de ne three h yp otheses: A ,B , and C represen t the h yp othesis that the car is b ehind Do or A, Do or B, or Do or C. Again, let's apply the table metho d: Prior Lik eliho o d P osterior p(H)p(Dj H)p(H) p(Dj H)p(Hj D) A B C Filling in the priors is easy b ecause w e are told that the prizes are arranged at random, whic h suggests that the car is equally lik ely to b e b ehind an y do or. Figuring out the lik eliho o ds tak es some though t, but with reasonable care w e can b e con den t that w e ha v e it righ t: If the car is actually b ehind A, Mon t y could safely op en Do ors B or C. So the probabilit y that he c ho oses B is . And since the car is actually b ehind A, the probabilit y that the car is not b ehind B is . If the car is actually b ehind B, Mon t y has to op en do or C, so the probabilit y that he op ens do or B is . Finally , if the car is b ehind Do or C, Mon t
