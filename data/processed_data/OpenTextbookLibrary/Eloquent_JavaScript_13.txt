the book, Chapters 13to19, describes the tools that browser Java Script has access to. You ll learn to display things on the screen (Chapters 14and17), respond to user input ( Chapter ), and communicate over the network ( Chapter ). There are again two project chapters in this part: building a platform game and apixel paint program . Chapter describes Node.js, and Chapter builds a small website using that tool. Typographicconventions In this book, text written in a monospaced font will represent elements of programs. Sometimes these are self-su icient fragments, and sometimes they just refer to part of a nearby program. Programs (of which you have already seen a few) are written as follows: function factorial(n) if (n ) return ; else return factorial(n - ) n; Sometimes, to show the output that a program produces, the expected output is written after it, with two slashes and an arrow in front. console.log(factorial( )); 40320 Good luck! Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort, it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The essence stays invisibly below. Master Yuan-Ma, The Book of Programming Chapter1 Values,Types,and Operators In the computer s world, there is only data. You can read data, modify data, create new data but that which isn t data cannot be mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and is thus fundamentally alike. Bitsare any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zeros and ones. Inside the computer, they take forms such as a high or low electrical charge, a strong or weak signal, or a shiny
