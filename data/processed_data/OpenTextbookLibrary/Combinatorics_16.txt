design theory coding theory Part I Enumeration Chapter Basic Counting Techniques When we are trying to count the number of ways in which something can happen, sometimes the answer is very obvious. For example, if a doughnut shop has five different kinds of doughnuts for sale and you are planning to buy one doughnut, then you have five choices. There are some ways in which the situation can become slightly more complicated. Perhaps you haven t decided whether you ll buy a doughnut or a bagel, and the store also sells three kinds of bagels. Or perhaps you want a cup of coffee to go with your doughnut, and there are four different kinds of coffee, each of which comes in three different sizes. These particular examples are fairly small and straightforward, and you could list all of the possible options if you wished. The goal of this chapter is to use simple examples like these to demonstrate two rules that allow us to count the outcomes not only in these situations, but in much more complicated circumstances. These rules are the product rule , and the sum rule . . The product rule The product rule is a rule that applies when we there is more than one variable (i.e. thing that can change) involved in determining the final outcome. EXAMPLE . Consider the example of buying coffee at a coffee shop that sells four varieties and three sizes. When you are choosing your coffee, you need to choose both variety and size. One way of figuring out how many choices you have in total, would be to make a table. You could label the columns with the sizes,
