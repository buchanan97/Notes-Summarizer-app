the truth values of the two propos itions I wanted to leave and I left. Or consider the proposition I wanted to leave but I did not leave. Here, the word but has the same logicalmeaning as the word and, but the connotation is very di erent. So, in mathematical lo gic, we use symbols to represent logical operators. These symbols do not carry a ny connotation beyond their de ned logical meaning. The logical operators corresponding to the English words and, or, and not are , , and . De nition . Letpandqbe propositions. Then p q,p q, and pare propositions, whose truth values are given by the rules: p qis true when both pis true and qis true, and in no other case. p qis true when either pis true, or qis true, or both pandqare true, and in no other case. pis true when pis false, and in no other case. The operators , , and are referred to as conjunction ,disjunction , and negation , respectively. (Note that p qis read as pandq, p qis read as porq, and pis read as not p. ) Theseoperatorscanbeusedinmorecomplicatedexpressions ,suchas p ( q) or (p q) (q r). A proposition made up of simpler propositions and logical operators is called a compound proposition . Parentheses can be used in compound expressions to indicate the order in which the oper ators are to be evaluated. In the absence of parentheses, the order of evalu ation is determined byprecedence rules . For the logical operators de ned above, the rules are that has higher precedence that , and has precedence over . This means that in the absence of parentheses, any
