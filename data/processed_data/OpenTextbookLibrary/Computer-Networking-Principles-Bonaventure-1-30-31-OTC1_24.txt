or optical signal between two directly connected devices. Several types of physical mediums are used in practice : electrical cable. Information can be transmitted over different types of electrical cables. The most common ones are the twisted pairs that are used in the telephone network, but also in enterprise networks and coaxial cables. Coaxial cables are still used in cable TV networks, but are no longer used in enterprise networks. Some networking technologies operate over the classical electrical cable. optical ber. Optical bers are frequently used in public and enterprise networks when the distance between the communication devices is larger than one kilometer. There are two main types of optical bers : multimode and monomode. Multimode is much cheaper than monomode ber because a LED can be An interesting historical discussion of the OSI-TCP IP debate may be found in Russel06 Chapter .

Due to the different modes of propagation of light, monomode bers are limited to distances of a few kilometers while multimode bers can be used over distances greater than several tens of kilometers. In both cases, repeaters can be used to regenerate the optical signal at one endpoint of a ber to send it over another ber. wireless. In this case, a radio signal is used to encode the information exchanged between the communicating devices. Many types of modulation techniques are used to
