Finally, there is the blue button , which is used to activate the morphic halo , an array of handles that are used to perform operations on the on-screen objects themselves, such as rotating them or resizing them; see Figure (c). If you let the mouse linger over a handle, a help balloon will explain its function. Click the blue button on the workspace. Grab the handle near the bottom left corner and drag it to rotate the workspace. We recommend that right-handed people con gure their mouse to put the red button on the left side of their mouse, the yellow button on the right, and use a clickable scroll wheel, if one is available, for the blue button. If you don t have a clickable scroll wheel, then you can get the Morphic halo by holding down the altoroption key while clicking the red button. If you are using a Macintosh without a second mouse button, you can simulate one by holding down the key while clicking the mouse.
