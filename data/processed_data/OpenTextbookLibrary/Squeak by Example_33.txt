class de nes a method named initialize , it will be called right after the object is created. So, when we evaluate SBECell new , the message initialize will be sent automatically to this newly created object. Initialize A rst application methods are used to set up the state of objects, typically to set their instance variables; this is exactly what we are doing here. The rst thing that this method does (line ) is to execute the initialize method of its superclass, Simple Switch Morph . The idea here is that any inherited state will be properly initialized by the initialize method of the superclass. It is always a good idea to initialize inherited state by sending super initialize before doing anything else; we don t know exactly what Simple Switch Morph s initialize method will do, and we don t care, but it s a fair bet that it will set up some instance variables to hold reasonable default values, so we had better call it, or we risk starting in an unclean state. The rest of the method sets up the state of this object. Sending self label: '' , for example, sets the label of this object to the empty string. The expression corner: probably needs some explanation. represents a Point object with xandycoordinates both set to . In fact, sends the message to the number 0with argument . The effect will be that the number 0will ask the Point class to create a new instance with coordinates ( , ). Now we send this newly created point the message corner: , which causes it to create a Rectangle with corners and . This newly created
