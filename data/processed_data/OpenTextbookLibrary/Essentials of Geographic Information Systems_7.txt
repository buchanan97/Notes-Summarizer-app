local focus (e.g., Which way is the nearest hospital? ) or more complex with a more global perspective (e.g ., How is urbanization impacting biodiversity hotspots around the world? ). The thread that unifies such questions is geography. For instance, the question of where? is an essential part of the questions Where is the nearest hospital? and Where are t he biodiversity hotspots in relation to cities? Being able to articulate questions clearly and to break them into manageable pieces are very valuable skills when using and applying a geographic information system (GIS). Though there may be no such thing a s a dumb question, some questions are indeed better than others. Learning how to ask the right question takes practice and is often more difficult than finding the answer Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org books Saylor.org itself. However, when we ask the right question, problems are more easily solved and our understanding of the world is improved. There are five general types of geographic questions that we can ask and that GIS can help us to answer. Each type of question is listed here and is also followed by a few examples (Nyerges 1991). Questions about geographic location : Where is it? Why is it here or there? How much of it is here or there? Questions about geographic distribution : Is it distributed locally or globally? Is it spatially clustered or dispersed? Where are the boundaries? Questions about geographic association : What else is near it? What else occurs with it? What is absent in its presence? Questions about geographic interaction : Is it linked to something else? What is the nature of this association? How much interaction occurs
