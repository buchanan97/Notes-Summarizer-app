I'll use draw , which takes the position dictionary as the second parameter: nx.draw(G, positions, node color COLORS , node shape 's ', node size 2500, with labels True) draw uses positions to determine the locations of the nodes. To add the edge labels, we use draw networkx edge labels : Chapter Graphs nx.draw networkx edge labels(G, positions, edge labels drive times) The edge labels parameter expects a dictionary that maps from each pair of nodes to a label; in this case, the labels are driving times between cities. And that's how I generated Figure . In both of these examples, the nodes are strings, but in general they can be any hashable type. Random graphs A random graph is just what it sounds like: a graph with nodes and edges generated at random. Of course, there are many random processes that can generate graphs, so there are many kinds of random graphs. One of the more interesting kinds is the Erd os-R enyi model, studied by Paul Erd os and Alfr ed R enyi in the 1960s. An Erd os-R enyi graph (ER graph) is characterized by two parameters: nis the number of nodes and pis the probability that there is an edge between any two nodes. See http: thinkcomplex.com er . Erd os and R enyi studied the properties of these random graphs; one of their surprising results is the existence of abrupt changes in the properties of random graphs as random edges are added. One of the properties that displays this kind of transition is connectivity. An undirected graph is connected if there is a path from every node to every other node. In an ER graph,
