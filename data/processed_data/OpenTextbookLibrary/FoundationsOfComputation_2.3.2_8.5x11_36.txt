Consider a table that lists a logical output value for every c ombination of values of several propositional variables. Ass ume that at least one of the output values is true. Then there is a proposition cont aining those variables such that the value of the proposition for each possibl e combination of the values of the variables is precisely the value speci ed in th e table. It is possible to choose the proposition to be in disjunctive normal form. Proof.Consider any row in the table for which the output value is T. Form a conjunction of simple terms as follows: For each variable, p, whose value is Tin that row, include pitself in the conjunction; for each variable, q, whose value is Fin the row, include qin the conjunction. The value of this conjunction is T for the combination of variable values given in that row of th e table, since each of the terms in the conjuction is true for that combination of variables. Furthermore, for any otherpossible combination of variable values, the value of the conjunction will be F, since at least one of the simple terms in the conjunction will be false. Take the disjunction of all such conjunctions constructed i n this way, for each row in the table where the output value is true. This disj unction has the value Tif and only if one of the conjunctions that make it up has the va lue T and that is precisely when the output value speci ed by the ta ble is T. So, this disjunction of conjunctions satis es the requirements of t he theorem. As an example, consider the table in
