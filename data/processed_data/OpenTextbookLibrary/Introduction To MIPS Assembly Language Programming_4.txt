useful, and well worth the cost of a free download. The second reason I wrote this book is that I could not find an assembly programming book that met the need I had in teachin g assembly programming. I believe that learning assembly programming is important to every Computer Science student because the principals in assembly affect how high level languages and programs in those languages are implemented. I have purposefully st ructured the topics in this text to illustrate how concepts such as memory organization (static, heap, and stack) affect variable allocation in high level languages. The chapter on program control is intended to make the student aware of structured progra mming, which is the basis for control structures in all modern high level languages. Even arrays make more sense in a high level language once one understands how they are implemented, and why. This text is intended to be more than a book about assembly language programming, but to extend assembly language into the principals on which the higher level languages are built. Finally writing a book is the best way to organize my own thoughts. Much of the material in this text existed for years as a jumble in my own mind. Producing slides and programs for class helped clarify the concepts , but it was when I had to provide a larger organization of the ideas that many of them finally gelled for me. Forcing yourself to explain a concept, particularly in the bru tal detail of writing it out, is the best way to organize and learn things. There are other details about this book that need to be mentioned. Because this book is electronic,
