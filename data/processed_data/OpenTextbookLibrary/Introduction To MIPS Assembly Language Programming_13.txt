computers use volts, but many modern computers use volts, and any positive v oltage is valid). If a flip -flop has a positive voltage it is called high or on (true) , and if it has volts it is low or off (false) . In addition hardware is made up of gates that which can either be open (true) or closed (false). Finally the goal of a c omputer is to be able to work with data that a person can understand. These numbers are always large, and hard to represent as a series of true or false values. When the values become large, p eople work best with numbers, so the binary number is called false, and is called true. Thus while computers work with binary, there are a number of ways we can talk about that binary. If the discussion is about memory, the value is high, on, or . When the purpose is to describe a gate, it is open closed . If ther e is a logical operations values can be true false . The following table summarizes the binary value naming conventions. T F Number Switch Voltage Gate F Off Low Closed T On High Open Table - : Various names for binary values In addition to the various names, engineers are more comfortable with real operators. This book will follow the convention that " " is an OR operator, " " is an AND operator, and "!" (pronounced bang ) is a not operator. Some stud ents are uncomfortable with the ambiguity in the names for true and false. They often feel that the way the binary values were presented in their mathematics classes
