I added a line to Clean Fem Preg : df.loc df.birthwgt lb , birthwgt lb np.nan This statement replaces invalid values with np.nan . The attribute locprovides several ways to select rows and columns from a Data Frame. In this example, the rst expression in brackets is the row indexer; the second expression selects the column. The expression df.birthwgt lb yields a Series of type bool , where True indicates that the condition is true. When a boolean Series is used as an index, it selects only the elements that satisfy the condition. Interpretation To work with data e ectively, you have to think on two levels at the same time: the level of statistics and the level of context. As an example, let's look at the sequence of outcomes for a few respondents. Because of the way the data les are organized, we have to do some processing to collect the pregnancy data for each respondent. Here's a function that does that: def Make Preg Map(df): d defaultdict(list) for index, caseid in df.caseid.iteritems(): d caseid .append(index) return d dfis the Data Frame with pregnancy data. The iteritems method enumerates the index (row number) and caseid for each pregnancy. dis a dictionary that maps from each case ID to a list of indices. If you are not familiar with defaultdict , it is in the Python collections module. Using d, we can look up a respondent and get the indices of that respondent's pregnancies. . Exercises This example looks up one respondent and prints a list of outcomes for her pregnancies: caseid 10229 preg map nsfg.Make Preg Map(df) indices preg map caseid df.outcome indices .values indices is the list of
