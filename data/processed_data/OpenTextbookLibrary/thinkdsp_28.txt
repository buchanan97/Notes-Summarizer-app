Wave provides make spectrogram , which returns a Spectrogram object: spectrogram wave.make spectrogram(seg length ) spectrogram.plot(high ) seg length is the number of samples in each segment. I chose because FFT is most e cient when the number of samples is a power of . Figure shows the result. The x-axis shows time from to seconds. The y-axis shows frequency from to Hz. I cut o the top part of the spectrogram; the full range goes to Hz, which is half of the framerate. The spectrogram shows clearly that frequency increases linearly over time. Similarly, in the spectrogram of an exponential chirp, we can see the shape of the exponential curve. However, notice that the peak in each column is blurred across cells. This blurring re ects the limited resolution of the spectrogram. The Gabor limit Thetime resolution of the spectrogram is the duration of the segments, which corresponds to the width of the cells in the spectrogram. Since each segment is frames, and there are , frames per second, the duration of each segment is about seconds. Thefrequency resolution is the frequency range between elements in the spectrum, which corresponds to the height of the cells. With frames, we . Leakage get frequency components over a range from to Hz, so the range between components is Hz. More generally, if nis the segment length, the spectrum contains n components. If the framerate is r, the maximum frequency in the spectrum is r . So the time resolution is n
