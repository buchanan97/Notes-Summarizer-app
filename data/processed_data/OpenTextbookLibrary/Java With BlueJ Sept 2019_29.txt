for a class. As Figure illustrates, you just need to click on Help and then click on Java Class Libraries . Choosing this results in an internet browser opening to a page where, on the left pane, you can find and click on the entry for String (or some other class) to view documentation which includes information about methods. Figure : Getting documentation on Java classes Several example pro grams follow that demonstrate how to use the various methods of the String class. To use a String method it is necessary that you reference the object and the method. For example, to obtain the length of s use the expression s.length() . Note the variable n ame is followed by a period which is followed by the method name and any arguments enclosed in parentheses. In object -oriented terminology we are asking the object s to execute its length() method. Example, obtaining the length of a string In many applicat ions it is necessary to examine a text string, characterby -character, to ensure it conforms to certain rules. For instance, when a user resets a password there may be restrictions that at least one character is in uppercase, that at least one character is alphabetic, etc. To do this processing where we examine the string character -bycharacter we need to know how long the string is. The String class has a method named length which returns, to the point where it is called, an integer value that is the length of the string. The following program shows the method being used; see line in particular: int password Length password.length(); When this line executes the method is invoked and returns a
