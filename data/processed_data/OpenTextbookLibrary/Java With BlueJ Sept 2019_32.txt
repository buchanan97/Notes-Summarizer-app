Length is of type int String s1 "John A. Smith"; String s2 "John A Smith"; Display s1 and s2 Display true or false according to whether they are equal or not System.out.println("The strings"); System.out.println(s1); System.out.println(s2); boolean equals Result s1 .equals(s2); System.out.println(equals Result); Showing the result of using equals( ) Catenation operator We have seen the operator before, but the operands were always numeric. The operator can also be used to add (i.e. caten ate) strings. It is used frequently in statements that generate output. If at least one operand is a string then a result is formed by joining two strings. Joining two strings is called catenation. When one operand is not a string then the equivalent strin g representing that non - string s value is generated, and then the catenation of two strings is carried out forming a new string as a result. For instance if you want to display a message "The value of x is " followed by the value of x you just code: System.out.println( "The value of x is " x); However, suppose you wanted to display a string and show the sum of two numbers. Consider: int x ; int y ; System.out.println( "the total is " x y); Someone might expect the output from the above to be: The total is but it is not, rather the output is: The total is 1011 The reason this happens is that the expression is evaluated from left to right. The first is adding a string and a number producing the string "The total is " . Hence the second is addi ng a string and a number producing the string "The total is 1011".
