in high-level lang uages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized applications. Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: interpreters andcompilers . An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations. OUTPUTSOURCE CODEINTERPRETER A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the source code , and the translated program is called the object code or the executable . Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation. OUTPUT CODEOBJECTEXECUTOR CODESOURCECOMPILER Python is considered an interpreted language because Python programs are executed by an interpreter. There are two ways to use the interpreter: command-line mode and script mode. In command-line mode, you type Python programs and the interpreter prints the result: What is a program? python Python ( , Apr 2005, : : ) Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more i nformation. print The rst line of this example is the command that starts the Python interpreter. The next two lines are messages from the interpreter. The third line starts wit h , which is the prompt the interpreter uses to indicate that it is ready. We typedprint , and the interpreter replied . Alternatively, you can write a program in a le and use the interpreter to execute the contents of the le. Such a le is called a script . For example, we used a text editor to create a le named latoya.py with the following contents: print By convention, les
