of embedded systems, we begin with a typical desktop system and examine the structure of the language along with basic examples. Once we have a decent grounding in syntax, structure, and the development cycle, we switch over to an embedded system, namely an Arduino based development system. This course is designed so that you can do considerable work at home with minimal cost if you choose to (this is entirely optional, but programming these little beasties can be addicting so be forewarned). Along with this course text and the associated lab manual, you will need an Arduino Uno board (about ) and a USB host cable. A small wall wart power adapter for it may also be useful. There s a lot of free C programming info on the Internet but if you prefer print books and want more detail, you may also wish to purchase one of the many C programming texts available. Two good titles are Kochan s book Programming in C and the one by Deitel Deitel, C-How to Program. Whichever book you choose, make sure that its focus is C and not C . You will also need a desktop C compiler. Just about any will do, including Visual C C , Borland, Code Warrior, or even GCC. A couple of decent freeware compilers available on the Internet include Pelles C and Miracle C. Frequently Asked Questions Why learn C language programming? C is perhaps the most widely used development language today. That alone is a good reason to consider it but there s more: It is a modern structured language that has been standardized (ANSI). It is modular, allowing reuse of code. It is widely
