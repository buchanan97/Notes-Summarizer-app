exercise. Becoming more aware of our biases, limitations, and preferences permits us to take full advantage of geographic information systems with confidence. KEY TAKEAWAYS There is no single or universal definition of a GIS; it is defined and used in many different ways. One of the key features of a GIS is that it integrates spatial data with attribute data. EXERCISES . Explore the web for mapping mashups that match your personal interests.

Geographic Information Systems and Science. 2nd ed. West Sussex, England: John Wiley. Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org books Saylor.org Chapter Map Anatomy Maps and mapping are essential components of any and all geographic information systems (GISs). For instance, maps constitute both the input and output of a GIS. Hence a GIS utilizes many concepts and themes from cartography , the formal study of maps and mapping. Therefore, in order for us to become proficient with GISs, we need to learn more about cartography, maps, and mapping. The first part of this chapter defines what a map is and describes a few key map types. Next, cartographic or mapping conventions are discussed with particular emphasis placed upon map scale, coordinate systems, and map projections. The ch apter concludes with a discussion of the process of map abstraction as it relates to GISs. This chapter provides the foundations for working with, integrating, and making maps with GISs.
