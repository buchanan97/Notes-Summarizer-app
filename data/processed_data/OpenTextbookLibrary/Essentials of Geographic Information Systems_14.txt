far apart locations are situated, space is a more abstract concept that is more commonly described rather than measured. For example, space can be described as empty, public, or private. Within the scope of a GIS, we are interested in space, and in particular, we are interested in what fills particular spaces and how and why things are distributed across space. In this sense, space is a somewh at ambiguous and generic term that is used to denote the general geographic area of interest. Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org books Saylor.org One kind of space that is of particular relevance to a GIS is topological space. Simply put, topological space is concerned with the nature of relationships and t he connectivity of locations within a given space. What is important within topological space are ( ) how locations are (or are not) related or connected to each other and ( ) the rules that govern such geographic relationships. Transportation maps such as those for subways provide some of the best illustrations of topological spaces (see Figure "Metro Map from London" and Figure "Metro Map from Moscow" ). When using such maps, we are primarily concerned with how to get from one stop to another along a transportation network. Certain rules also govern how we can travel along the network (e.g., transferring lines is possible only at a few key stops; we can travel only one direction on a particular line). Such maps may be of little use when traveling ar ound a city by car or foot, but they show the local transportation network and how locations are linked together in an effective and efficient manner.
