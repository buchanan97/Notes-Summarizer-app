piece of the memory hierarchy for most machines. In the worst-case scenario we saw how a memory reference could be pushed down to slower and slower performance media before finally being satisfied. If you step back, you can view the disk paging space as having the same relationship to main memory as main memory has to cache. The same kinds of optimizations apply too, and locality of reference is important. Y ou can run programs that are lar ger than the main memory system of your machine, but sometimes at greatly decreased performance. When we look at memory optimizations in link , we will concentrate on keeping the activity in the fastest parts of the memory system and avoiding the slow parts. Improving Memory Performance Given the importance, in the area of high performance computing, of the performance of a computer s memory subsystem, many techniques have been used to improve the performance of the memory systems of computers. The two attributes of memory system performance are generally bandwidth and latency . Some memory system design changes improve one at the expense of the other , and other improvements positively impact both bandwidth and latency . Bandwidth generally focuses on the best possible steady-state transfer rate of a memory system. Usually this is measured while running a long unit-stride loop reading or reading and writing memory . footnote Latency is a measure of the worst-case performance of a memory system as it moves a small amount of data such as a - or -bit word between the processor and memory . Both are important because they are an important part of most high performance applications. See the STREAM section in
