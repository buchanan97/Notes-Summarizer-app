unreliable connectionless service is that it may duplicate SDUs. Some unreliable connectionless service providers may deliver an SDU sent by a user twice or even more. This is illustrated by the time-sequence diagram below. Finally, some unreliable connectionless service providers may deliver to a destination a different SDU than the one that was supplied in the Data.request. This is illustrated in the gure below. When a user interacts with a service provider, it must precisely know the limitations of the underlying service to be able to overcome any problem that may arise. This requires a precise de nition of the characteristics of the underlying service. Another important characteristic of the connectionless service is whether it preserves the ordering of the SDUs sent by one user. From the user s viewpoint, this is often a desirable characteristic. This is illustrated in the gure below. However, many connectionless services, and in particular the unreliable services, do not guarantee that they will always preserve the ordering of the SDUs sent by each user. This is illustrated in the gure below. .
