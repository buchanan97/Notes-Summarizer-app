Application: Logic Circuits Computers have a reputation not always deserved for being l ogical. But fundamentally, deep down, they are made of logic in a very rea l sense. The building blocks of computers are logic gates , which are electronic components that compute the values of simple propositions such as p qand p. (Each gate is in turn built of even smaller electronic components calle d transistors, but this
