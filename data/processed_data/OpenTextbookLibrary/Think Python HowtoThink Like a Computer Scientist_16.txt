far are , , and 'Hello, World! '. These values belong to different types :2is an integer , is a oating-point number , and 'Hello, World! 'is astring , so-called because the letters it contains are strung together. If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you: type( ) class 'int' type( ) class 'float ' type( 'Hello, World! ') class 'str' In these results, the word class is used in the sense of a category; a type is a category of values. Not surprisingly, integers belong to the type int, strings belong to strand oating-point numbers belong to float . What about values like ' 'and' '? They look like numbers, but they are in quotation marks like strings. type( ' ') class 'str' type( ' ') class 'str' They re strings. When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of digits, as in , , . This is not a legal integer in Python, but it is legal: , , ( , , ) That s not what we expected at all! Python interprets , , as a comma-separated sequence of integers. We ll learn more about this kind of sequence later. Formal and natural languages Natural languages are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally. Formal languages are languages that are designed by people for speci c applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a
