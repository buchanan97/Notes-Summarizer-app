that are used in Java.) Many CPUs can liter ally execute more than one thread simultaneously such CPUs contain multiple cores, each of which can run a thread but there is always a limit on the number of threads that can be executed at the same time. Since there are often more threads than can be executed simul taneously, the computer has to be CHAPTER . THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE able switch its attention from one thread to another, just as a timesharing computer switches its attention from one user to another. In general, a thread t hat is being executed will continue to run until one of several things happens: The thread might voluntarily yieldcontrol, to give other threads a chance to run. The thread might have to wait for some asynchronous event to o ccur. For example, the thread might request some data from the disk drive, or it migh t wait for the user to press a key. While it is waiting, the thread is said to be blocked, and other threads, if any, have a chance to run. When the event occurs, an interrupt will wak e up the thread so that it can continue running. The thread might use up its allotted slice of time and be suspe nded to allow other threads to run. Most computers can forcibly suspend a thread in thi s way; computers that can do that are said to use preemptive multitasking . To do preemptive multitasking, a computer needs a special timer device that generates an int errupt at regular intervals, such as times per second. When a timer interrupt occurs, t he CPU has a chance to switch from
