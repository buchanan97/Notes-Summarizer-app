interconnections are represented by edges . Chapter Graphs Alice Bob Chuck Figure : A directed graph that represents a social network. For example, you could represent a road map with a node for each city and an edge for each road between cities. Or you could represent a social network using a node for each person, with an edge between two people if they are friends. In some graphs, edges have attributes like length, cost, or weight. For example, in a road map, the length of an edge might represent distance between cities or travel time. In a social network there might be di erent kinds of edges to represent di erent kinds of relationships: friends, business associates, etc. Edges may be directed orundirected , depending on whether the relationships they represent are asymmetric or symmetric. In a road map, you might represent a one-way street with a directed edge and a two-way street with an undirected edge. In some social networks, like Facebook, friendship is symmetric: if Ais friends with Bthen Bis friends with A. But on Twitter, for example, the follows" relationship is not symmetric; if Afollows B, that doesn't imply that Bfollows A. So you might use undirected edges to represent a Facebook network and directed edges for Twitter. Graphs have interesting mathematical properties, and there is a branch of mathematics called graph theory that studies them. Graphs are also useful, because there are many real world problems that can be solved using graph algorithms . For example, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is an e cient way to nd the shortest path from a node to all other Network X Albany Boston NYC Philly Figure : An
