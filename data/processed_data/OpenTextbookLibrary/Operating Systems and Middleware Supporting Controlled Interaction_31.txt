interaction under control. For example, in my earlier example of a pair of threads, one produces some data and the other consumes it. In such a situation, there is no great mystery to how the data can ow from one to the other, because both are using the same computer's memory. The hard part is regulating the use of that shared memory. This stands in contrast to the interactions across time and space, which I will address in Sections and . If the producer and consumer run at di erent times, or on di erent computers, the operating system and middleware will need to take pains to convey the data from one to the other. Supporting Interaction Across Time General purpose operating systems all support some mechanism for computations to leave results in long-term storage, from which they can be retrieved by later computations. Because this storage persists even when the system is shut down and started back up, it is known as persistent storage. Normally, operating systems provide persistent storage in the form of named les, which are organized into a hierarchy of directories or folders. Other forms of persistent storage, such as relational database tables and application-de ned persistent objects, are generally supported by middleware. In Chapter , I focus on le systems, though I also explain some of the connections with middleware. For example, I compare the storage of le directories with that of database indexes. This comparison is particularly important as these areas are converging. Already the underlying mechanisms are very similar, and le systems are starting to support indexing services like those provided by database systems. There are two general categories of le APIs, both
