to nd an interesting conclusion and a chain of logical deductions that leads from the premises to that conclusion. Checking that the deductions are valid is t he mechanical, computational side of logic. This chapter is mostly about the mechanics of logic. We will i nvestigate logic as a branch of mathematics, with its own symbols, formu las, and rules of computation. Your object is to learn the rules of logic, to understand why they are valid, and to develop skill in applying them. As with any branch of mathematics, there is a certain beauty to the symbols and for mulas themselves. But it is the applications that bring the subject to life for m ost people. We will, of course, cover some applications as we go along. In a sense, though, the real applications of logic include much of computer science and o f mathematics itself. Among the fundamental elements of thought, and therefore of logic, are propositions. A proposition is a statement that has a truth value: It is either CHAPTER . LOGIC AND PROOF true or false. Grass is green and are propositions . In the rst part of this chapter, we will study propositional logic , which takes propositions as basic and considers how they can be combined and manipulated . This branch of logic has surprising application to the design of the elec tronic circuits that make up computers. Logic gets more interesting when we consider the internal st ructure of propositions. In English, a proposition is expressed as a sentenc e, and, as you know from studying grammar, sentences have parts. A simple sente nce like Grass is green has a subject and apredicate
