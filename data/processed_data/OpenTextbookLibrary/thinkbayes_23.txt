prizes are arranged at random. The ob ject of the game is to guess whic h do or has the car. If y ou guess righ t, y ou get to k eep the car. Y ou pic k a do or, whic h w e will call Do or A. W e'll call the other do ors B and C. Before op ening the do or y ou c hose, Mon t y increases the susp ense b y op ening either Do or B or C, whic hev er do es not ha v e the car. (If the car is actually b ehind Do or A, Mon t y can safely op en B or C, so he c ho oses one at random.) Then Mon t y o ers y ou the option to stic k with y our original c hoice or switc h to the one remaining unop ened do or. The question is, should y ou stic k or switc h or do es it mak e no di erence? Most p eople ha v e the strong in tuition that it mak es no di erence. There are t w o do ors left, they reason, so the c hance that the car is b ehind Do or A is . But that is wrong. In fact, the c hance of winning if y ou stic k with Do or A is only ; if y ou switc h, y our c hances are . By applying Ba y es's theorem, w e can break this problem in to simple pieces, and ma yb e con vince ourselv es that the correct
