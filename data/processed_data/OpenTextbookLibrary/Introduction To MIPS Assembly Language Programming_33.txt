the correct sign of the number. Bit shifti ng for division is useful in some algorithms such as a binary search finding parents in a complete binary tree. But again it should be avoided unless there is a strong reason to use it in a HLL. This leaves two issues. The first is why can this method no t be implemented with constants other than the powers of . The reason is that division is only distributive in one direction over addition, and in our case it is the wrong direction. Consider the equation . It is easy to show that division over ad dition does not work in this case. ( ) The second issue is why the dividend must be positive. To see why this is true, consider the following division, - . This result in the following: 11111001 11111100 - Two things about this answer. First in this case the sign bit, , must be shifted in to maintain the sign of the integer. Second in this case the lowest bit, a , is truncated. This means that - is truncated down to - . However, many programmers believ e that - should truncate to - . Whether the correct answer is - or - is debatable, and different programming languages have implemented as either value (for example, Java implements - - , but Python - as - ). This same problem occurs with many operations on negative numbers, such a modulus. And while such debates might be fun, and programmers should realize that these issues can occur, it is not the purpose of this book to do more than present the problem . Chapter . Boolean
