Exercises The code for this chapter is in thech02directory of Think Java Code2. See page x for instructions on how to download the repository. Before you start the exercises, we recommend that you compile and run the examples. If you have not already read Appendix??, now might be a good time. It describes the Dr Java Interactions pane, which is a useful way to develop and test short fragments of code without writing a complete class definition. Exercise If you are using this book in a class, you might enjoy this exercise. Find a partner and play Stump the Chump: Start with a program that compiles and runs correctly. One player looks away, while the other player adds an error to the program. Then the first player tries to find and fix the error. You get two points if you find the error without compiling the program, one point if you find it using the compiler, and your opponent gets a point if you don t find it. Exercise The point of this exercise is ( ) to use string concatenation to display values with dif
