Services and protocols Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org courses cs402 The Saylor Foundation Computer Networking : Principles, Protocols and Practice, Release Theconnectionless service is widely used in computer networks as we will see later in this book. Several variations to this basic service have been proposed. One of these is the con rmed connectionless service . This service uses a Data.con rm primitive in addition to the classical Data.request and Data.indication primitives. This primitive is issued by the service provider to con rm to a user the delivery of a previously sent SDU to its recipient. Note that, like the registered service of the post of ce, the Data.con rm only indicates that the SDU has been delivered to the destination user. The Data.con rm primitive does not indicate whether the SDU has been processed by the destination user. This con rmed connectionless service is illustrated in the gure below. Source Provider Destination Time DATA.request(S, D, "M") DATA.indication(S, D, "M") DATA.confirm Figure : A con rmed connectionless service The connectionless service we have described earlier is frequently used by users who need to exchange small SDUs. Users needing to either send or receive several different and potentially large SDUs, or who need structured exchanges often prefer the connection-oriented service. An invocation of the connection-oriented service is divided into three phases. The rst phase is the establishment of aconnection. A connection is a temporary association between
