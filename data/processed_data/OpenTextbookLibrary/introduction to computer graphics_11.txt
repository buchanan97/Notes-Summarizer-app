one number that speci es the level of gray on a black-to-white scale. Ty pically, shades of gray are used. Early computer screens used indexed color , where only a small set of colors, usually or , could be displayed. For an indexed color display, there is a numbered list of possible colors, and the color of a pixel is speci ed by an integer giving the po sition of the color in the list. In any case, the color values for all the pixels on the screen a re stored in a large block of memory known as a frame bu er . Changing the image on the screen requires changing color values that are stored in the frame bu er. The screen is redra wn many times per second, so that almost immediately after the color values are changed i n the frame bu er, the colors of CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION the pixels on the screen will be changed to match, and the disp layed image will change. A computer screen used in this way is the basic model of raster graphics . The term raster technically refers to the mechanism used on older v acuum tube computer monitors: An electron beam would move along the rows of pixels, making t hem glow. The beam was moved across the screen by powerful magnets that would de ec t the path of the electrons. The stronger the beam, the brighter the glow of the pixel, so the b rightness of the pixels could be controlled by modulating the intensity of the electron beam . The color values stored in the frame bu er were used to determine the intensity
