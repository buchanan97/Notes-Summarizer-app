of Networks An Introduction to Computer Networks, Release S1 destination next hop A C B D E The table for S2 might be as follows, where we have consolidated destinations A and C for visual simplicity. S2 destination next hop A,C D E B In the network diagrammed above, all links are point-to-point, and so each interface corresponds to the unique immediate neighbor reached by that interface. We can thus replace the interface entries in the next hop column with the name of the corresponding neighbor . For human readers, using neighbors in thenext hop column is usually much more readable. S1 s table can now be written as follows (with consolidation of the entries for B, D and E): S1 destination next hop A A C C B,D,E S2 A central feature of datagram forwarding is that each packet is forwarded in isolation ; the switches involved do not have any awareness of any higher-layer logical connections established between endpoints. This is also called stateless forwarding, in that the forwarding tables have no per-connection state. RFC 1122 put it this way (in the context of IP-layer datagram forwarding): To improve robustness of the communication system, gateways are designed to be stateless, forwarding each IP datagram independently of other datagrams. As a result, redundant paths can be exploited to provide robust service in spite of failures of intervening gateways and networks. The fundamental alternative to datagram forwarding is virtual circuits , Virtual Circuits . In virtualcircuit networks, each router maintains state about each connection passing through it; different connections can be routed differently. If packet forwarding depends, for example, on per-connection information eg both TCP port numbers it is not
