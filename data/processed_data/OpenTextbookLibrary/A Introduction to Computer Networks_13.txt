Quick search, however, only works for all-alphabetic strings; strings with hyphens such as wi- and Dif e-Hellman fail. The index is an effective alternative. The book uses a modest set of unicode special characters. Unfortunately, some of these characters are not universally available in all browsers (and I have not yet gured out how to encapsulate fonts in the html). The comma-separated characters in the rst line, below, appear to have the most limited support. The math-italic Greek letters are not present in the so-called Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane, but the symbols are, so that is not the entire explanation. x,y, , , , , , , , , ,", , , (,), , , , , , , , , , , , , ,?, , , , , , , , , , ,,,,,,,,,,, The characters above should look roughly as they do in the following image (the rst line is the one most likely to fail): If they do not, there are two options for browser-based viewing. If the second and third rows above display successfully, there is a unicode-safer version of the book (both online and zipped) available at intronetworks.cs.luc.edu that has the characters in the rst row above replaced by those in the second row. The other alternative is to add an appropriate font. Generally Firefox and Internet Explorer display the necessary characters out of the box, but Chrome may not. The Chrome situation can usually be xed, at least on real computers, by adding a font and then tweaking the Chrome font settings. I have had good luck with Symbola (at shapecatcher.com unicodefonts.html and other places). To install the font, extract the .ttf le
