or code block associat ed with the if test. What is desired is a single answer, or a single bit, which is either true ( ) or false ( ). This has two consequences. The first is that in some programming languages (e.g. C C ) a variable other than a Boolean can be used in the st atement, with the consequence that is false, and anything but is true. For example, in the statement if(x ), the result is true. The equal operator returns a non -zero value, , which is true. This has been the cause of many bugs in C C , and mos t modern compilers at least complain about this. This will also be the result of some expressions in assembler, and there will be no compiler to complain about it. So be careful. The second consequence of the logical Boolean operator is that once a part of it has failed, the entire statement has to fail, and so the rest of the statement will not be executed. This is called short circuiting, and all logical operators are thus short circuiting operators. To see why this is true, consider the if test about . In this if test, if x is , then (x ! ) is false. Since false and anything is false, there is no need to evaluate the second part of this equation, and so the statement (y x ) is not executed. Many programmers will recognize this code, as it is a common pattern for protecting against a zero divide. The importa
