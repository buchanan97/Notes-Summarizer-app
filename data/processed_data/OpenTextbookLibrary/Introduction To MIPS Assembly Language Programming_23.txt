of binary whole numbers needs to be covered. When o ne-bit binary numbers are added, the following results are possible: ; ; ; and . This is just like decimal numbers. For example, , and the result is still one digit. A problem occurs, however, when adding two decimal numbers where the result is greater than the base of the number (for decimal, the base is ). For example, . The result cannot be represented in one digit, so a carry digit is created. The result of is with a carry of . The carry of is considered in the next digit, which is actually adding digits (the two addends, and the carry). So , where the 's digit ( ) is the result of the tw o addends ( and ) and the carry ( ). The result of in binary is analogous to the situation in base . The addition of is with a carry of , and there is a carry to the next digit of . An illustration of binary addition is show n in the figure below. Figure - : Binary whole number addition Here the first bit adds , which yields a in this bit and a carry bit of . The next bit now has to add (the extra one is the carry bit), which yields a for this bit and a carry bit of . If you follow the arithmetic through, you have 0011 ( ) 0111 ( ) 1010 (1010). Chapter .
