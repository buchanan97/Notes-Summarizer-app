might be called traditional programming. However, as programs becomela rger, additional structure is needed to help deal with their complexity. One of the most e ective t ools that has been found is objectoriented programming, which is discussed in the next sectio n. Objects and Object-oriented Programming Programs must be designed . No one can just sit down at the computer and compose a program of any complexity. The discipline called software engineering is concerned with the construction of correct, working, well-written progra ms. The software engineer tries to use accepted and proven methods for analyzing the problem to be solved and for designing a program to solve that problem. During the 1970s and into the 80s, the primary software engin eering methodology was structured programming . The structured programming approach to program design was based on the following advice: To solve a large problem, brea k the problem into several pieces and work on each piece separately; to solve each piece, treat it as a new problem which can itself be broken down into smaller problems; eventually, you will w ork your way down to problems that can be solved directly, without further decomposition . This approach is called top-down programming . There is nothing wrong with top-down programming. It is a val uable and often-used approach to problem-solving. However, it is incomplete. Fo r one thing, it deals almost entirely with producing the instructions necessary to solve a problem. But as time went on, people realized that the design of the data structures for a program was at least as important as the design of subroutines and control structures. Top-down pro gramming doesn t give adequate consideration to
