physical? I have. I like to look over the numbers when the doctor hands me the results, just to chuckle and wonder what they all mean. To me, a non-physician, they re all pretty much gobbledy-gook. They tell me my TBC is x10 E6 L, that I have Absolute Neutrophils, and a slightly out-of-range NT-pro BNP (just pg m L, whatever the heck that means). When I use the worddatain the context of the hierarchy, this is what I mean: recorded measurements, often (but not always) quantitative, that have not yet beeninterpreted. They may be very precise, but they re also quite meaningless without the context in which to understand them. They d even be meaningless to a physicianif I didn t provide the labels; try telling your doctor that you have something and see whether he she freaks out. The good news is that when we re at the data stage of the hierarchy, we at least have the stuff in an electronic form so we can start to dosomething with it. We also often make choices at this stage about how toorganizethe data, choosing the appropriate type of atomic and or aggregate data structures that we ll discuss in detail in Chapters and beyond. This will allow us to bring our analysis equipment to bear on the problem in powerful ways. . DEFINING DATA SCIENCE5 Information Data becomesinformationwhen itinformsus of something;i.e., when we know what it means. Getting large amounts of data organized, formatted, and labeled the right way are jobs for the data scientist, since turning that morass into useful knowledge is impossible without those steps. When the aspects of the real world that we ve collected
