static, as in: static char b ; Then b is set to only on the first call. Subsequent entries into the function would not incur the initialization. If it did reinitialize, what would be the sense of having a static type? This is explained by the fact that a static does not usually use the stack method of storage, but rather is placed at a fixed memory location. Again, C does not require the use of a stack, rather, it is a typical implementation. Embedded Controllers Two useful but not very common modifiers are volatile and const. A volatile variable is one that can be accessed or modified by another process or task. This has some very special uses (typically, to prevent an optimizing compiler from being too aggressive with optimizations-more on this later). The const modifier is used for declaring constants, that is, variables that should not change value. In some instances this is preferred over using define as type checking is now available (but you can t use the two interchangeably). Scope Scope has to do with where variables are seen . We have already mentioned the idea of global and local in previous work but it is time to delve a little deeper. Generally, variables only exist within the block they are declared. While it is legal to declare variables inside of a conditional or loop block, we normally declare variables at the very beginning of a function. Consequently, these variables are known within the function. That is, their scope of reference is within the function. Nothing outside of the function knows anything about them. Thus, we say that they are local, or perhaps localized, to the
