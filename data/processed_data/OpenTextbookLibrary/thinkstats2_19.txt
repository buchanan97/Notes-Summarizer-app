indices for pregnancies corresponding to respondent 10229 . Using this list as an index into df.outcome selects the indicated rows and yields a Series. Instead of printing the whole Series, I selected the values attribute, which is a Num Py array. The outcome code 1indicates a live birth. Code 4indicates a miscarriage; that is, a pregnancy that ended spontaneously, usually with no known medical cause. Statistically this respondent is not unusual. Miscarriages are common and there are other respondents who reported as many or more. But remembering the context, this data tells the story of a woman who was pregnant six times, each time ending in miscarriage. Her seventh and most recent pregnancy ended in a live birth. If we consider this data with empathy, it is natural to be moved by the story it tells. Each record in the NSFG dataset represents a person who provided honest answers to many personal and di cult questions. We can use this data to answer statistical questions about family life, reproduction, and health. At the same time, we have an obligation to consider the people represented by the data, and to a ord them respect and gratitude.
