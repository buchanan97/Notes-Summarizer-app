a program that can take over the job of doing such per-vertex computa tions. Similarly, some work has to be done for each pixel inside the primitive. A fragment sha der can take over the job of performing such per-pixel computations. (Fragment shad ers are also called pixel shaders.) The idea of programmable graphics hardware was very success ful so successful that in Open GL , the usual per-vertex and per-fragment processi ng was deprecated (meaning that its use was discouraged). And in Open GL , it was removed fr om the Open GL standard, although it is still present as an optional extension. In pra ctice, all the original features of Open GL are still supported in desktop versions of Open GL and will probably continue to be available in the future. On the embedded system side, howeve r, with Open GL ES and later, the use of shaders is mandatory, and a large part of the Open GL API has been completely removed. Web GL, the version of Open GL for use in web browsers , is based on Open GL ES, and it also requires shaders to get anything at all done. Neve rtheless, we will begin our study of Open GL with version . Most of the concepts and many of the d etails from that version are still relevant, and it o ers an easier entry point for someon e new to D graphics programming. Open GL shaders are written in GLSL(Open GL Shading Language). Like Open GL itself, GLSL has gone through several versions. We will spend some ti me later in the course studying GLSL ES, the version used with Web GL and
