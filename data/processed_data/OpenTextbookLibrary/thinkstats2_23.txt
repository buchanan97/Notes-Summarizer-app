this book I created a class, Hist, that represents histograms and provides the methods that operate on them. Representing histograms The Hist constructor can take a sequence, dictionary, pandas Series, or another Hist. You can instantiate a Hist object like this: import thinkstats2 hist thinkstats2.Hist( , , , , ) hist Hist( : , : , : , : ) Hist objects provide Freq , which takes a value and returns its frequency: hist.Freq( ) The bracket operator does the same thing: hist If you look up a value that has never appeared, the frequency is . hist.Freq( ) Values returns an unsorted list of the values in the Hist: hist.Values() , , , To loop through the values in order, you can use the built-in function sorted : for val in sorted(hist.Values()): print(val, hist.Freq(val)) Or you can use Items to iterate through value-frequency pairs: for val, freq in hist.Items(): print(val, freq) .

Plotting histograms For this book I wrote a module called thinkplot.py that provides functions for plotting Hists and other objects de ned in thinkstats2.py . It is based onpyplot , which is part of the matplotlib package. See Section for information about installing matplotlib . To plothist withthinkplot , try this: import thinkplot thinkplot.Hist(hist) thinkplot.Show(xlabel value , ylabel frequency ) You can read the documentation for thinkplot athttp: greenteapress. com thinkstats2 thinkplot.html .
