referring to the top-left corner of the pixel. Another way of thinking a bout this is to say that integer coordinates refer to the lines between pixels, rather than t o the pixels themselves. But that still doesn t determine exactly which pixels are a ected wh en a geometric shape is drawn. For example, here are two lines drawn using HTML canvas graphics , shown greatly magni ed. The lines were speci ed to be colored black with a one-pixel line width: The top line was drawn from the point ( , ) to the point ( , ). In canvas graphics, integer coordinates correspond to the lines between pixels , but when a one-pixel line is drawn, it extends one-half pixel on either side of the in nitely thi n geometric line. So for the top line, the line as it is drawn lies half in one row of pixels and half in another row. The graphics system, which uses antialiasing, rendered the line by color ing both rows of pixels gray. The bottom line was drawn from the point ( , ) to ( , ). In this case, the line lies exactly along one line of pixels, which gets colored black. T he gray pixels at the ends of the bottom line have to do with the fact that the line only extends halfway into the pixels at its endpoints. Other graphics systems might render the same lin es di erently. The interactive demo c2 pixel-magni er.html lets you experiment with pixels and antia
