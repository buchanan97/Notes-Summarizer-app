Note that for any compound proposition P,Pis a tautology if and only if Pis a contradiction. (Here and in the future, I use uppercase letters to represent compound propositions. Pstands for any formula made up of simple propositions, propositional variables, and logi cal operators.) Logical equivalence can be de ned in terms of tautology: De nition . Twocompoundpropositions, Pand Q, aresaidtobe logically equivalent if and only if the proposition P Qis a tautology. The assertion that Pis logically equivalent to Qwill be expressed symbolically as P Q. For example, ( p q) ( p q), andp q (p q) (p q). Exercises .Give the three truth tables that de ne the logical operators , , and . .Insert parentheses into the following compound propositio ns to show the order in which the operators are evaluated: a) p q b)p q p c)p q r d)p q r .Listthe16possiblecombinationsoftruthvaluesforthefou rpropositionalvariables s,p,q,r. Try to nd a systematic way to list the values. (Hint: Start wi th the eightcombinations ofvalues for p,q, andr, asgiven in thetruth tablein Figure . Now, explain why there are possible combinations of values for ve variables, and describe how they could be listed systematically.) CHAPTER . LOGIC AND PROOF .Some of the following compound propositions are tautologie s, some are contradictions, and some are neither. In each case, use a truth table to decide to which of these categories the proposition belongs: a)(p (p q)) q b)((p q) (q r)) (p r) c)p ( p) d)(p
