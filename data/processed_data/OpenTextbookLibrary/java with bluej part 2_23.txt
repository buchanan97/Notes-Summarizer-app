of B: ci;j Pn k 1ai;kbk;j . Suppose A and B are two matrices as described in the previous question. However now let A be an m midentity matrix. An identity matrix is one that has 1s on the diagonal and 0s everywhere else. That is, Ai;j where i jand Ai;j where i6 j For example, if m we have A The program then multiplies matrix A by the matrix B the result should be B. . Write a method init Sequential Values( that sets the values of the elements of a matrix to the values , , , For example suppose CHAPTER . ARRAYS OF ARRAYS A is a matrix of rows and columns. Then the result of calling init Sequential Values(A) we have A . Similar to the previous question, but place the sequential values in column order. Write a method init Sequential Values( that sets the values of the elements of a matrix to the values , , , For example suppose A is a matrix of rows and columns. Then the result of calling init Sequential Values(A) we have A Chapter Validation and Text Manipulation In this chapter we look at issues related to verifying the correctness of your program, verifying the validity of argument values passed into a method, verifying the validity of eld values, and the general concern of manipulating textual data. Testing and the assert statement When we develop a program there is the important task of verifying the program works as required. Often a programmer will insert multiple println statements to display program data, or to track the progression of some algorithm. In addition to debugging a program this way a programmer
