feedback, I will add you to the contributor list (unless you ask to be omitted). If you include at least part of the sentence the error appears in, that makes it easy for me to search. Page and section numbers are ne, too, but not as easy to work with. Thanks! Before I started writing, my thoughts about this book bene ted from conversations with Boulos Harb at Google and Aurelio Ramos, formerly at Harmonix Music Systems. During the Fall 2013 semester, Nathan Lintz and Ian Daniher worked with me on an independent study project and helped me with the rst draft of this book. On Reddit's DSP forum, the anonymous user Ramjet Soundwave helped me x a problem with my implementation of Brownian Noise. And andodli found a typo. In Spring 2015 I had the pleasure of teaching this material along with Prof. Oscar Mur-Miranda and Prof. Siddhartan Govindasamy. Both made many suggestions and corrections. Silas Gyger corrected an arithmetic error. Giuseppe Masetti sent a number of very helpful suggestions. Eric Peters sent many helpful suggestions. Special thanks to Freesound, which is the source of many of the sound samples I use in this book, and to the Freesound users who uploaded those sounds. I include some of their wave les in the Git Hub repository for this book, using the original le names, so it should be easy to nd their sources. Unfortunately, most Freesound users don't make their real names available, so I can only thank them using their user names. Samples used in this book were contributed by Freesound users: iluppai, wc , thirsk, docquesting, kleeb, landup, zippi1, themusicalnomad, bcjordan, rockwehrmann, marcgascon7, jcveliz. Thank you all!
