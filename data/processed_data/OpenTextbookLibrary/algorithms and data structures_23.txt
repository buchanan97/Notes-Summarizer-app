program examples of algorithm snapshots Computer-driven visualization: characteristics and techniques The computer-driven graphics screen is a powerful new communications medium; indeed, it is the only two-way mass communications medium we know. Other mass communications media the printed e.g. recorded audio and video are one-way streets suitable for delivering a monolog. The unique strength of our new medium is interactive presentation of information. Ideally, the viewer drives the presentation, not just by pushing a start button and turning a channel selector, but controls the presentation at every step. He controls the flow not only with commands such as "faster", "slower", "repeat", "skip", "play this backwards", but more important, with a barrage of "what if?" questions. What if the area of this triangle becomes zero? What if we double the load on this beam? What if world population grows a bit faster? This powerful new medium challenges us to use it well. When using any medium, we must ask: What can it do well, and what does it do poorly? The computer-driven screen is ideally suited for rapid and accurate display of information that can be deduced from large amounts of data by means of straightforward algorithms and lengthy computation. It can do so in response to a variety of user inputs as long as this variety is contained in an algorithmically tractable, narrow domain of discourse. It is not adept at tasks that require judgment, experience, or insight. By comparison, a speaker at the blackboard is slow and inaccurate and can only call upon small amounts of data and tiny computations; we hope she makes up for this technical shortcoming by good judgment, teaching experience, and insight into the subject.
