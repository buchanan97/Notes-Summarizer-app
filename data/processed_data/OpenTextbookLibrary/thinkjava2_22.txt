this rule, but we ll get to that later. A common source of confusion is that some stringslooklike integers, but they are not. For example,messagecan contain the string" ", which is made up of the characters' ',' ', and' '. But that is not the same thing as the integer123: message " "; legal message ; not legal Variables must beinitialized(assigned for the first time) before they can be used. You can declare a variable and then assign a value later, as in the previous example. You can also declare and initialize on the same line: String message "Hello!"; int hour ; int minute ; Memory Diagrams Because Java uses the symbol for assignment, it is tempting to interpret the statementa bas a statement of equality. It is not! Equality is commutative, and assignment is not. For example, in mathematics ifa , then7 a. In Javaa ;is a legal assignment statement, but Chapter Variables and Operators a;is not. The left side of an assignment statement has to be a variable name (storage location). Also, in mathematics, a statement of equality is true for all time. Ifa b now,ais always equal tob. In Java, an assignment statement can make two variables equal, but they don t have to stay that way: int a ; int b a; a and b are now equal a ; a and b are no longer equal The third line changes the value ofa, but it does not change the value ofb, so they are no longer equal. Taken together, the variables in a program and their current values make up the program sstate. Figure shows the state of the program after these assignment statements run.
