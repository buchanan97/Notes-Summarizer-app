as well as tutorials and videos whic h can help you get started. All circuits in this book are implemented in Logisim, and can be found at http: www.chuckkann.com Hardware The following is a complete list of hardware that is needed to implement the basic circuits in the text. It is broken down into sections; chips, tools, and miscellaneous parts. For a complete list of parts with part numbers from various retailers, please go to http: www.chuckkann.com . When buying the hardware, users will often have some of the needed material already on hand. Things like wire stripper, needle -nose pliers, and a small flat -blade screw driver are common items that many people will have readily available. Other items like wire or volt batteries are often available from other uses. If you already own some of the parts or equipment listed below, there is no need to buy them again. Chips Except for the 7805 voltage regulator, a ll of the chips are standard 7400 series chips. For more information about 7400 series logic chips, see http: en.wikipedia.org wiki 7400 series . A complete list of 7400 series chips can be found at http: en.wikipedia.org wiki List of 7400 series integrated circuits . The chips in this series represent most of the logic components and Integrated Circuits (ICs) that are needed to implement most digital logic applications. The numbering on chips is as follows: DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS 74tttsssn where : indicates the chip is a 7400 series chip ttt: the type of logic used. In this text, the following are valid: o blank - transitor -transitor logic (ttl) o HC - high speed CMOS o HCT - high
