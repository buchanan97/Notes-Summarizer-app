The width of this range suggests, correctly , that w e are still quite uncertain ab out ho w man y lo comotiv es there are. Cum ulativ e distribution functions In the previous section w e computed p ercen tiles b y iterating through the v alues and probabilities in a Pmf. If w e need to compute more than a few p ercen tiles, it is more e cien t to use a cum ulativ e distribution function, or Cdf. Cdfs and Pmfs are equiv alen t in the sense that they con tain the same information ab out the distribution, and y ou can alw a ys con v ert from one to the other. The adv an tage of the Cdf is that y ou can compute p ercen tiles more e cien tly . thinkbayes pro vides a Cdf class that represen ts a cum ulativ e distribution function. Pmf pro vides a metho d that mak es the corresp onding Cdf: cdf suite.Make Cdf() And Cdf pro vides a function named Percentile interval cdf.Percentile( ), cdf.Percentile( ) Con v erting from a Pmf to a Cdf tak es time prop ortional to the n um b er of v alues, len(pmf) . The Cdf stores the v alues and probabilities in sorted lists, so lo oking up a probabilit y to get the
