When is reached, we have , which is group of hundred, tens , and ones. So t he number , would be: , Base can be handled in the same manner. The number (base ) is group of two and ones, or just (base ). Counting in base is the same. To count in base , the numbers are , , , , , , , etc. Any number in base can be converted to base using this principal. Consider 101011 , which is: In order to work with base number, it is necessary to know the value of the powers of . The following table gives the powers of for the first numbers (to ). It is highly recommended that students memorize at least the first values of this table (to ), as these will be used frequently. n 2n n 2n n 2n n 2n 4096 8192 1024 16348 2048 32768 Table - : Values of 2n for n The first powers of are the most important because the values of 2n are named when n is a decimal number evenly dividable by . For example is Kilo, is Meg, etc. The names for these value of 2n are given in the following table. Using these names and the values of 2n from - , it is possible to name all of the binary numbers easily as illustrated below. To find the value of , we would write: K K Older programmers will recognize this as the limit to the segment size on older PC's which could only address bits. Younger students will recognize the value of , which is: G G M was the limit of memory
