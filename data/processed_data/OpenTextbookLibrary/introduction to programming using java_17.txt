LANDSCAPE Akeyboard andmousefor user input. Amonitor andprinter which can be used to display the computer s output. Anaudio output device that allows the computer to play sounds. Anetwork interface that allows the computer to communicate with other computer s that are connected to it on a network, either wirelessly or by wire. Ascanner that converts images into coded binary numbers that can be st ored and manipulated on the computer. The list of devices is entirely open ended, and computer syst ems are built so that they can easily be expanded by adding new devices. Somehow the CPU has to communicate with and control all these devices. The CPU can only do this by executi ng machine language instructions (which is all it can do, period). The way this works is that for each device in a system, there is adevice driver , which consists of software that the CPU executes when it has to deal with the device. Installing a new device on a system generall y has two steps: plugging the device physically into the computer, and installing the dev ice driver software. Without the device driver, the actual physical device would be useless, since the CPU would not be able to communicate with it. A computer system consisting of many devices is typically or ganized by connecting those devices to one or more busses. A bus is a set of wires that carry various sorts of information between the devices connected to those wires. The wires carr y data, addresses, and control signals. An address directs the data to a particular device a nd perhaps to a particular register or location within that device. Control signals can
