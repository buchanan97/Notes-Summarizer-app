Exercises . Evaluate the following Java expressions: "x " "The remainder is " ( ) ( ) "is the remainder" "x " "is the value of x" "is the value of x" "" . Write a program with String variables: first Name, middle Initials, last Name . Assign values to these variables to represent your name. Print a line that shows your name displayed with the last name first, followed by a comma, followed by your first name, and then your middle initials. For example: Smith, John A Implied declarations using var A recent (March 2018, Java ) addition to Java is the ability to declare and initialize variables using var; for example: var sum ; var count ; var name ""; With the above statements the variables sum, count and name have been initialized, and their types (determined by their initialized values) are double, int, and String respectively. Consider the listing below which is a rewrite of List ing but all declarations use var. Listing : Using var to declare initialize variables public class Using Var public static void main(String args) variable password is of type String variable password Le ngth is of type int var s1 "John A. Smith"; var s2 "John A Smith"; Display s1 and s2 Display true or false according to whether they are equal or not System.out.println("The strings" ); System.out.println(s1); System.out.println(s2); var equals Result s1.equals(s2); System.out.println(equals Result); Java is a strongly typed language. When the compiler sees a statement such as var s1 "John A. Smith"; it determines s1 is of type String and so we could not follow that with a statement such as s1 ; The int value cannot be assigned to
