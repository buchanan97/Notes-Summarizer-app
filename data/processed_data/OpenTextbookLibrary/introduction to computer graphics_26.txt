API called Web GPU has been under developm ent for some time and is already implemented in some Web browsers. These newer API s are complex and low-level. They are designed more for speed and e ciency rather than eas e-of-use. Metal, Direct3 D, and Vulkan are not covered in this textbook, but Web GPU is introd uced in Chapter . For most of the book, we will use Open GL, because it provides an easier in troduction to D graphics, and Web GL, because it is still the major API for D graphics in Web browsers. I have said that Open GL is an API, but in fact it is a series of AP Is that have been subject to repeated extension and revision. In 2023, the current (an d perhaps nal) version is , which was rst released in 2017. It is very di erent from the ver sion from 1992. Furthermore, there is a specialized version called Open GL ES for embedde d systems such as mobile phones and tablets. And there is also Web GL, for use in Web browsers, which is basically a port of Open GL ES. It will be useful to know something about how and wh y Open GL has changed. First of all, you should know that Open GL was designed as a cl ient server system. The server, which is responsible for controlling the computer s display and performing graphics CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION computations, carries out commands issued by the client. Ty pically, the server is a GPU, including its graphics processors and memory. The server ex ecutes Open GL commands. The client is the CPU in the same computer,
