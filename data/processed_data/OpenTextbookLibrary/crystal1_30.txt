the diva.upper() part just not work? Did it get skipped? Did we do it wrong somehow? Even more confusing, putting the .upper() call directly in the printstatement seems to work but only temporarily. Accessing divaa moment later appears to revert it back to its old value: diva "Ariana Grande" print("I just love !".format(diva.upper())) print("When does the next album come out?".format(diva)) CHAPTER . CALCULATIONS I just love ARIANA GRANDE! When does the next Ariana Grande album come out? Therootcauseofthisandpracticallyallperplexing Pythonprinting can be discovered by consulting the memory picture. Here s how it starts out when we first definediva: Now say we do this: new var name diva.upper() The result is this picture: And now we see the reason for it all. The contents of thedivavariable itself areunchangedby the method call. Calling .upper() ondivadidn t change the string value indiva: it merelyreturned a modifiedcopyof the string. Think of it this way: if I asked you, what is your name in Pig Latin? and you told me, that would not intrinsicallychangeyour actual name to be in Pig Latin. You would simply be returning to me the Pig Latin version of it in response to my query. . RETURN VALUES41 You could argue this behavior of Python s is dumb, or at best misleading, and I m actually inclined to agree with you in this case. But of course beggars can t be choosers: someone took the time to write the.upper()method for us, so if we want to take advantage of it we have to use his her owner s manual. And the fact is that many (perhaps even most) Python functions methods including many of the ones from Pandas, which we ll use
