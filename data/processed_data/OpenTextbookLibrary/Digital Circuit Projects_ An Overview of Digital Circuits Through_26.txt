when A , B , and C . We can write this minterm a AB'C' (A and not -B and not -C), since A is true, and B and C are both false. Function f1(A,B,C) also has three other minter ms, AB'C, ABC', and ABC. So the DNF for the function f1(A,B,C) would be written as: f1(A,B,C) AB'C' AB'C ABC' ABC Note that these minterms are numbers , , , and in the table so a short hand to write the DNF is the following: f1(A,B,C) ( , , , ) Likewise f2(A,B,C) can be written as: f2(A,B,C) A'B'C A'BC AB'C ABC ( , , , ) Note that any Boolean function can be written in DNF, and DNF requires only types of operations, the AND, OR, and NOT. This is why AND, OR, and NOT are universal . The proof of this is left for the exercises at the end of the chapter. Another way to represent the function is Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). CNF can be described as a pr oduct of sums, or an AND or ORs. The use of CNF is left to the problems at the end of the chapter. Note that the number starts at , not . DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS Boolean Relationships The next question to be asked is if any Boolean function can be wr itten in DNF, should DNF be used to represent all Boolean functions? The answer to this question comes from the engineering the circuit. At some point, a computer has to implement the Boolean function as a circuit. That circuit will need gate for each operation. And in engineering the circuit, t he goal is to minimize
