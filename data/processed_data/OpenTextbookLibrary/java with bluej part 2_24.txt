can also use the Java assert statement. This statement has two forms: assert expression ; assert expression :expression ; where expression 1is a boolean expression and expression 2is a value. If expression 1evaluates to false then your Java progam will terminate immediately with an Assertion error. If the expression 1evaluates to true then nothing happens. In the second form of the assert statement expression provides a message to be displayed when the program is terminated. CHAPTER . VALIDATION AND TEXT MANIPULATION Example . Calculate age Suppose we need to calculate a person's age in years. Given a person's birthdate we can easily make this calculation. In Java two classes introduced were Local Date and Period . These classes model dates according to the ISO-8601 calendar system. Using Local Date we can instantiate an instance representing a particular date such as today , or, someone's birthday. Period can be used to create an interval that has a start date and an end date, such as the period between someone's birthday and today. Period has several utility methods; for instance get Years() returns the number of years in a period. The following method, given someone's date of birth in the format YYYY-MM-DD calculates age in years. get Age - determines age in years param yyyymmdd birthdate YYYY -MM -DD return age in years public static int get Age ( String yyyymmdd ) int yyyy Integer . parse Int ( yyyymmdd . substring ( , )); int mm Integer . parse Int ( yyyymmdd . substring ( , )); int dd Integer . parse Int ( yyyymmdd . substring ( , ) ); age is difference between today and the birthday Local Date
