little nervous, having heard that computer programming is di cult to learn. The C version has always forced me to choose between two unsatisfying options: either to explain include ,void main() , , and , and risk confusing or intimidating some of the students right at the start, or to tell them, Jus t don t worry about all of that stu now; we will talk about it later, and risk the same thing. The educational objectives at this point in the course are to introduce students to the idea of a programming language and to get them to write their rst program, thereby introducing them to the programming environment. The Python program has exactly what is needed to do these things, and nothing more. Comparing the explanatory text of the program in each version of the book fur - ther illustrates what this means to the beginning student. There are thirteen paragraphs of explanation of Hello, world! in the C version; in the Pytho n version, there are only two. More importantly, the missing eleven paragr aphs do not deal with the big ideas in computer programming but with the minutia of C syntax. I found this same thing happening throughout the book. Whole paragraphs simply disappear from the Python version of the text because Python s much clearer syntax renders them unnecessary. Using a very high-level language like Python allows a teacher to postpone tal king about low-level details of the machine until students have the background that they need to better make sense of the details. It thus creates the ability to put rst things rst pedagogically. One of the best examples of this is the way
