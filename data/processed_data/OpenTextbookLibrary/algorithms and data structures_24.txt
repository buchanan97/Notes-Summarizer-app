way of another comparison, books and films may accurately and rapidly present results based on much data and computation, but they lack the ability to react to a user's input. Algorithm animation, the technique of displaying the state of programs in execution, is ideally suited for presentation on a graphics screen. There is a need for this type of computation, and there are techniques for producing them. The reasons for animating programs in execution fall into two major categories, which we label checking and exploring. Checking To understand an algorithm well, it is useful to understand it from several distinct points of view. One of them is the static point of view on which correctness proofs are based: Formulate invariants on the data and show that these are preserved under the program's operations. This abstract approach appeals to our rational mind. A second, equally important point of view, is dynamic: Watch the algorithm go through its paces on a variety of input data. This concrete approach appeals to our intuition. Whereas the static approach relies mainly on "thinking", the dynamic approach calls mostly for "doing" and "perceiving", and thus is a prime candidate for visual human Algorithms and Data Structures A Global Text . Algorithm animation computer interaction. In this use of algorithm animation, the user may be checking his understanding of the algorithm, or may be checking the algorithm's correctness in principle, he could reason this out, but in practice, it is faster and safer to have the computer animation as a double check. Exploring In a growing number of applications, computer visualization cannot be replaced by any other technique. This is the case, for example, in exploratory data
