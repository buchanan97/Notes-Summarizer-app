lar ge parallel processing systems. Because most high performance systems are based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processors, many techniques learned on one type of system transfer to the other systems. High performance RISC processors are designed to be easily inserted into a multiple-processor system with to CPUs accessing a single memory using symmetric multi pr ocessing (SMP). Programming multiple processors to solve a single problem adds its own set of additional challenges for the programmer . The programmer must be aware of how multiple processors operate together , and how work can be ef ficiently divided among those processors. Even though each processor is very powerful, and small numbers of processors can be put into a single enclosure, often there will be applications that are so lar ge they need to span multiple enclosures. In order to cooperate to solve the lar ger application, these enclosures are linked with a high-speed network to function as a network of workstations (NOW). A NOW can be used individually through a batch queuing system or can be used as a lar ge multicomputer using a message passing tool such as parallel virtual machine (PVM) or message-passing interface (MPI). For the lar gest problems with more data interactions and those users with compute budgets in the millions of dollars, there is still the top end of the high performance computing spectrum, the scalable parallel processing systems with hundreds to thousands of processors. These systems come in two flavors. One type is programmed using message passing. Instead of using a standard local area network, these systems are connected using a proprietary , scalable, high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnect (how is that for marketing speak?). Because
