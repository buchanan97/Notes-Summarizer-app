are based on a more solid understanding of calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and probability and statistics. I hope this unique way of organizing topics in two complementary chapters will provide xi a comprehensive view of the related concepts and techniques, as well as allow you to exibly choose relevant materials based on your learning teaching objectives and needs. If you are an instructor, here are some suggested uses for this textbook: One-semester course as an introduction to complex systems modeling Target audience: College freshmen or sophomores (or also for research projects by advanced high school students) Chapters to be covered: Part I and some modeling chapters selected from Parts II III One-semester course as an introduction to dynamical systems Target audience: Senior undergraduate or graduate students Chapters to be covered: Parts I II, plus Continuous Field Models chapters (both modeling and analysis) One-semester advanced course on complex systems modeling and analysis Target audience: Graduate students who already know dynamical systems Chapters to be covered: Part III (both modeling and analysis) Two-semester course sequence on both modeling and analysis of complex systems Target audience: Senior undergraduate or graduate students Chapters to be covered: Whole textbook Note that the chapters of this textbook are organized purely based on their content. They arenotdesigned to be convenient curricular modules that can be learned or taught in similar amounts of time. Some chapters (especially the preliminary ones) are very short and easy, while others (especially the analysis ones) are extensive and challenging.
