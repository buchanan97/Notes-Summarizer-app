we use the cookie cutter to stamp out cookies of a certain type, in an object-oriented program, we use a de nition of a class to create objects of a certain type. Writing an object-oriented program is largely a matter of designing classes and writing de nitions for those classes in Java. Designing a class is a matter of specifying all of the attributes and behaviors that are characteristic of that type of object. For example, suppose we are writing a drawing program. One type of object we would need for our program is a rectangle. A Rectangle object has two fundamental attributes, a length and a width . Given these attributes, we can de ne characteristic rectangle actions, such as the ability to calculate its area and the ability to draw itself. Identifying an object s attributes and actions is the kind of design activity that goes into developing an object-oriented program. Figure shows a UML diagram of our Rectangle class. Like the symbol for an object, a UML class symbol has up to three partitions. Unlike the UML object symbol, the label for a UML class gives just the class s name and it is not underlined. The second partition lists the class s attributes and the third partition lists the classes actions. Our rectangle has four attributes. The rst two, xandy, determine a rectangles position on a two-dimensional graph. The second two, length andwidth , determine a rectangle s dimensions. Note that the attributes have no values. This is because the class represents a general type of rectangle. It speci es what all rectangles have in common, without representing any particular rectangle. Like a cookie cutter for
