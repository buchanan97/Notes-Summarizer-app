Consider the following snippet of code: void doug( void ) int x ; x x ; printf( d n , x ); void dinsdale( void ) int x ; x x ; printf( d n , x ); Suppose you call doug() five times in a row and then call dinsdale() five times in a row. What would the resulting output look like? Embedded Controllers Embedded Controllers . C Arrays and Strings Introduction Up to now we haven t talked much about character strings, that is, variables that contain non-numeric data such as a person s name or address. There is no string variable type in C (unlike Python). In C, strings are nothing more than arrays of characters. Arrays are a simple grouping of like variables in a sequence, each with the same name and accessed via an index number. They behave similarly to arrays in most other languages (or lists in Python). C arrays may have one, two, or more dimensions. Here are a few example declarations: float results ; An array of floats long int x ; An array of longs, or bytes char y ; A two-dimension array, by chars each, bytes total Note the use of square brackets and the use of multiple sets of square brackets for higher dimension arrays. Also, C arrays are counted from index rather than For example, the first item of results is results . The last item is results . There is no such item here as results . That would constitute an illegal access. You can pre-initialize arrays by listing values within braces, each separated by a comma: double a , , , -
