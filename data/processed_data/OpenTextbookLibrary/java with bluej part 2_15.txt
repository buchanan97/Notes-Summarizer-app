always appropriate. If we were obtaining the values from input we would rst of all declare the array of the appropriate size and then proceed to read data into the array. The declaration statement for our Denver snowfall example would be: private double snowfall new double ; The program in Listing reads the data from a le named Snowfall In Inches.txt from the same folder as where the program is located. In this program you should note the following: line declares the two dimensional array with rows and columns. lines to read the data from the le. The outer loop controls the row subscript. Notice the use of the length eld the number of rows is snowfall.length() . The inner loop controls the column subscript. Notice again the use of the length eld. Each row is in fact an array, and the ith row is referenced by snowfall i the number of elements in the ithrow is snowfall i .length() . In line the value read is stored in the ithrow and jthcolumn ofsnowfall . Recall that the two dimensional storage structure the JVM creates is an array of arrays. And so in terms of the storage structure its true to say that the value is stored as the jth element of the itharray of snowfall . Lines to display the values in a tabular format. The output from the program is shown following the listing Listing : Reading array data 1import java . util . Scanner ; 2import java .io. File ; 3import java .io.
