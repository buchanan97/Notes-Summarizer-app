SSet supports the size (),add(x), and remove (x) methods with exactly the same semantics as in the USet interface. The di erence between a USet and an SSet is in the find (x) method: .find (x): locate xin the sorted set; Find the smallest element yin the set such that y x. Return yor null if no such element exists. This version of the find (x) operation is sometimes referred to as a successor search . It di ers in a fundamental way from USet:find (x) since it returns a meaningful result even when there is no element equal to x in the set. The distinction between the USet and SSet find (x) operations is very important and often missed. The extra functionality provided by an SSet usually comes with a price that includes both a larger running time and a higher implementation complexity. For example, most of the SSet implementations discussed in this book all have find (x) operations with running times that are logarithmic in the size of the set. On the other hand, the implementation of a USet as a Chained Hash Table in Chapter has afind (x) operation that runs in constant expected time. When choosing which of these structures to use, one should always use a USet unless the extra functionality o ered by an SSet is truly needed. Mathematical Background In this section, we review some mathematical notations and tools used throughout this book, including logarithms, big-Oh notation, and proba9 Introduction bility theory. This review will be brief and is not intended as an introduction. Readers who feel they are missing this background are encouraged to read, and do exercises from, the appropriate sections
