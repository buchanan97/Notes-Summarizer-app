point relates to by a preceeding super-script, e.g.,AP to indicate that point Pis in coordinate system A . Each point consists of three elements AP px, py, pz T. More formally,APis a linear combination of the three basis vectors that span A: AP px py pz ( ) . Locomotion, manipulation and their representations xyz x y z Figure . Two nested coordinate systems (also referred to as frames of reference). . Coordinate Systems and Frames of Reference As we know, not only the position of the robot is important, but also its orientation. In order to describe the orientation of a point, we will attach a coordinate system to it. Let XB, YBand ZBbe unit vectors that correspond to the principal axes of a coordinate system B . When expressed in coordinate system A , they are denoted A XB,A YBand A ZB. In order to express a vector that is given in one coordinate system in another, we need toproject each of its components to the unit vectors that span the target coordinate system. For example, if we consider only the axis A XB, which is given by A XB ( XB XA, XB YA, XB ZA)T( ) that is, the projections of XBonto XA, YAand ZA. Here, denotes the scalar product (also known as dot or inner product, see Appendix B. ). Note that all vectors in ( ) are unit vectors, i.e. their length is one. By following the definition of the scalar product, we have that A B A B cos cos , indeed reduces the projection of XBonto the unit vectors of A . This projection is illustrated in Figure . We can now
