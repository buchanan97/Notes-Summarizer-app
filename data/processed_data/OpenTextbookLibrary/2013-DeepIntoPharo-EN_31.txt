Net Name Resolver address For Name: 'www.esug.org'. client Socket connect To: server Address port: ; wait For Connection For: . client Socket is Connected true The connect To:port: message returns immediately after issuing the request to connect the socket to the system (through a primitive call). Message wait For Connection For: suspends the current process until the socket is connected to the server. It waits at most, 10seconds as requested by the parameter. If the socket is not connected after seconds, the Connection Timed Out exception is signaled. Otherwise, the execution can proceed by evaluating the expression client Socket is Connected which answers true. Exchange Data with Server Once the connection is established, the client can exchange (send receive) instances of Byte String with the server. Typically, the client sends some request to the server and then waits for a response. Web browsers act according to this schema. A web browser is a client that issues a request to some web server identi ed by the URL. Such a request is often the path to some resource on the server such as a html le or a picture. Then, the browser awaits the server response ( e.g., html code, picture bytes). TCP Client Script : Exchanging Data with some Server through a TCP Socket. client Socket data "create and connect the TCP client Socket" client Socket send Data: 'Hello server'. data : client Socket receive Data "Process data" Script shows the protocol to send and receive data through a client socket. Here, we send the string 'Hello server!' to the server using the send Data: message. Next, we send the receive Data message to our client socket to read the
