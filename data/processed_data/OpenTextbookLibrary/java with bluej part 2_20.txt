ARRAYS OF ARRAYS Example Ragged arrays:using row length Consider the following program that displays the number of trips per driver. In lines - this program determines the number of trips for driver iby just using the length eld for the array comprising row i.

EXAMPLES Example Representing a matrix In mathematics there is a structure called a matrix that, in Java terms, is just a two dimensional array. Operations such as addition and multiplication are de
