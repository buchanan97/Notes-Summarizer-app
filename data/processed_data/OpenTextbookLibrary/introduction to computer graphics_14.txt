display could copy the same image from the frame bu er to the screen. (As soon as raster displays became fast and inexpensive, however, th ey quickly displaced vector displays because of their ability to display all types of images reaso nably well.) CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION The divide between raster graphics and vector graphics pers ists in several areas of computer graphics. For example, it can be seen in a division between tw o categories of programs that can be used to create images: painting programs anddrawing programs . In a painting program, the image is represented as a grid of pixels, and the user creates an image by assigning colors to pixels. This might be done by using a drawing tool that acts like a painter s brush, or even by tools that draw geometric shapes such as lines or re ctangles. But the point in a painting program is to color the individual pixels, and it is only the pixel colors that are saved. To make this clearer, suppose that you use a painting program to draw a house, then draw a tree in front of the house. If you then erase the tree, you ll o nly reveal a blank background, not a house. In fact, the image never really contained a house a t all only individually colored pixels that the viewer might perceive as making up a picture o f a house. In a drawing program, the user creates an image by adding geom etric shapes, and the image isrepresentedasalistofthoseshapes.
