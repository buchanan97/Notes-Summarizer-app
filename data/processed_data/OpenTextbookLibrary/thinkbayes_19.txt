It is supp osed to b e the probabilit y of seeing the data under an y h yp othesis at all, but in the most general case it is hard to nail do wn what that means. Most often w e simplify things b y sp ecifying a set of h yp otheses that are Mutually exclusiv e: A t most one h yp othesis in the set can b e true, and Collectiv ely exhaustiv e: There are no other p ossibilities; at least one of the h yp otheses has to b e true. I use the w ord suite for a set of h yp otheses that has these prop erties. In the co okie problem, there are only t w o h yp otheses the co okie came from Bo wl or Bo wl and they are m utually exclusiv e and collectiv ely exhaustiv e. In that case w e can compute p(D) using the la w of total probabilit y , whic h sa ys that if there are t w o exclusiv e w a ys that something migh t happ en, y ou can add up the probabilities lik e this: p(D) p(B1) p(Dj B1) p(B2) p(Dj B2) Plugging in the v alues from the co okie problem, w e ha v e p(D) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) whic h is what w e computed earlier b y men tally com bining
