variable is used in arithmetic operations like deposits and withdrawals. The result would be angry customers and potential lawsuits. You can avoid the problem by representing the balance as an integer: int balance 12345; total number of cents This solution works as long as the number of cents doesn t exceed the largest int, which is about billion. Operators for Strings In general, you cannot perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings look like numbers. The following expressions are illegal: "Hello" - "World" "Hello" "World" Chapter Variables and Operators The operator works with strings, but it might not do what you expect. For strings, the operator performsconcatenation, which means joining end-toend. So"Hello, " "World!"yields the string"Hello, World!". Likewiseifyouhaveavariablecallednamethathastype String, theexpression "Hello, " nameappendsthevalueofnametothehellostring, whichcreates a personalized greeting. Since addition is defined for both numbers and strings, Java performs automatic conversions you may not expect: System.out.println( "Hello"); the output is Hello System.out.println("Hello" ); the output is Hello12 Java executes these operations from left to right. In the first line, 2is , and3 "Hello"is" Hello". But in the second line,"Hello" 1is "Hello1", and"Hello1" 2is"Hello12". When more than one operator appears in an expression, they are evaluated according to theorder of operations. Generally speaking, Java evaluates operators from left to right (as you saw in the previous section). But for numeric operators, Java follows mathematical conventions: Multiplication and division take precedence over addition and subtraction, which means they happen first. So1 3yields , not , and 2yields , not . If the operators have the same precedence, they are evaluated from left to right. So in the expressionminute , the multiplication happens first; if the value ofminuteis , we get5900 ,
