algebra to the role that constant numbers such as and play in or dinary algebra. Instead of the equals sign, Boolean algebra uses logical equ ivalence, , which has essentially the same meaning. For example, for propositions p,q, andr, the operator in p (q r) (p q) rmeans has the same value as, no matter what logical values p,q, andrhave. Many of the rules of Boolean algebra are fairly obvious, if yo u think a bit about what they mean. Even those that are not obvious can be ve ri ed easily by using a truth table. Figure .2lists the most important of these laws. You will notice that all these laws, except the rst, come in pair s: Each law in the pair can be obtained from the other by interchanging with and Twith F. This cuts down on the number of facts you have to remember. Just as an example, let s verify the rst rule in the table, th e Law of Double Negation. This law is just the old, basic grammar rule that tw o negatives make a positive. Although this rule is questionable as it app lies to English as it is actually used no matter what the grammarian says, I c an t get no satisfaction doesn t really mean I can get satisfaction the validity of the rule in logic can be veri ed just by computing the two possibl e cases: when p is true and when pis false. When pis true, then by the de nition of the operator, pis false. But then, again by the de nition of , the value of ( p) is true, which is the same
