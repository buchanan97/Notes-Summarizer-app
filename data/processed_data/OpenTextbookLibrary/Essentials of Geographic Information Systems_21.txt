exist. There are several professional communities and organizatio ns concerned with the use and application of a GIS, such as the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association ( http: urisa.org ) and the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure Association ( http: www.gsdi.org ). Unlike the previous example in which a GIS is applied to answer or solve a particular question, the developer approach to GISs is concerned with the development of the GIS as a software or technology platf orm. Rather than focusing on how a GIS is used and applied, the developer approach is concerned with improving, refining, and extending the tool and technology itself and is largely in the realm of computer programmers and software developers. The ongoing integration and evolution of GISs, maps, the Internet, and web -based mapping can be considered an outcome of the developer approach to GISs. In this regard, delivering maps, navigation tools, and user -friendly GISs to people via the Internet is the central challenge at hand. The underlying, and to a large extent hidden, logic and computer code that permit us to ask questions about how to get from point A to point B on a navigation website or to see where a new restaurant or open house is located on a web -based map are for the most part the domain of GIS programmers and developers. The Open Source Geospatial Foundation ( http: www.osgeo.org ) is another example of a community of GIS developers working to build and distribute open -source GIS software. It is the developer approach to GISs that drives and introduces innovation and is informed and guided by the existing needs and future demands of the application approach.
