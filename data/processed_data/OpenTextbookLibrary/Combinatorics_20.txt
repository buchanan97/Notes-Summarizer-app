aspects that vary can be quite artificial. Example serves as a good demonstration for a generalisation of the product rule as we stated it above. In that example, it would have been more natural to have considered from the start that there were four apparent aspects to the t-shirts that can vary: size; colour; image; and slogan. The total number of t-shirts she needed to produce was the product of the number of possible outcomes of each of these aspects: . THEOREM (Product Rule for many aspects). Suppose that when you are determining the total number of outcomes, you can identify kdifferent aspects that can vary. If for each ibetween 1andkthere arenipossible outcomes for the ith aspect, then the total number of possible outcomes wil l be k i 1ni(that is, the product as igoes from 1tokof theni). Now let s look at an example where we are trying to evaluate a probability. Since this course is about counting rather than probability, we ll restrict our attention to examples where all outcomes are equally likely. Under this assumption, in order to determine a probability, we can count the number of outcomes that have the property we re looking for, and divide by the total number of outcomes. EXAMPLE . Iswar has flipped a coin twice, and come up with heads both times. What is the probability that he will flip heads each of his next two tries? SOLUTION. To answer this, we consider each coin flip as a different aspect. There are two possible results for the third flip: heads or tails. For each of these, there are two possible results for the fourth flip: heads or tails. So in
