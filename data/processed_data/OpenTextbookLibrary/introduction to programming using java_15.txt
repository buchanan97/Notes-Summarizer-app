as binary numb ers. A binary number is made up of just two possible digits, zero and one. Each zero or one i s called a bit. So, a machine language instruction is just a sequence of zeros and ones. Ea ch particular sequence encodes some particular instruction. The data that the computer man ipulates is also encoded as binary numbers. In modern computers, each memory location holds a byte, which is a sequence of CHAPTER . THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE eight bits. A machine language instruction or a piece of data generally consists of several bytes, stored in consecutive memory locations. For example, when a CPU reads an instruction from memory, it might actually read four or eight bytes from four o r eight memory locations; the memory address of the instruction is the address of the rst o f those bytes. A computer can work directly with binary numbers because swi tches can readily represent such numbers: Turn the switch on to represent a one; turn it o to represent a zero. Machine language instructions are stored in memory as patterns of sw itches turned on or o . When a machine language instruction is loaded into the CPU, all tha t happens is that certain switches are turned on or o in the pattern that encodes that instructi on. The CPU is built to respond to this pattern by executing the instruction it encodes; it d oes this simply because of the way all the other switches in the CPU are wired together. So, you should understand this much about how computers work : Main memory holds machine language programs and data. These are encoded as bin ary
