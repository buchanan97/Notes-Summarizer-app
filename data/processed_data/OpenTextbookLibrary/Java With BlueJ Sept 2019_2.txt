where the basic component is the class . A Java class contains data and executable code. This chapter covers concepts that must be understood if one is to design and implement a Java -based system. The examples in the text, and solutions to many exercises, are available on the website for this text. Introduction This book is about programming in Java. We begin with short descriptions of Java and Blue J. We feel that Blue J is one of the simplest development environments for the beginning programmer to use. All examples in this text have been tested using Blue J. Sample solutions for odd-numbered exercises are available on the website for this text. Java, the beginning James Gosling is refer red to as the father of the Java programming language. He graduated with a BSc (1977) from the University of Calgary and a Ph D (1983) from Carnegie Mellon University. Later, in 1994 at Sun Microsystems he created the Java language while leading a team that was purposed with developing a handheld home - entertainment controller targeted at the digital cable television industry. That project did not produce the expected outcome, but in 1995, the team announced that the Netscape Navigator Internet browser w ould incorporate Java technology, and from there its adoption for implementing systems began. James Gosling has received several awards, including: 2007 - appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada. 2013 - named an Association of Computing Machinery Fe llow for Java, Ne WS, Emacs, Net Beans, and other contributions to programming languages, tools, and environments . 2015 - awarded the IEEE John von Neumann Medal for the Java programming language, Java Virtual Machine, and other
