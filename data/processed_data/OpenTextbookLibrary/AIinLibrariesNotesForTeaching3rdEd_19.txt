day, days a week on a vast number of sources. It is not expensive. In sum, machine translation can produce a bulk of translations of reasonable quality. Progress in this area is rapid for example, Ankur Bapna and co-authors have a paper Building Machine Translation Systems for the Next Thousand Languages (Bapna et al. 2022). Search and Navigation Once a text is in digital form it can be searched and navigated very efficiently, even if it has no preemptively prepared index. For example, the words 'butterflies' and 'rhopalocera' are synonyms, and 'lepidoptera' is a term for an order of insects that includes rhopalocera (i.e. it is a more general term). Imagine yourself to be a young person with a physical book on the subject of insects. You are interested in the specific topic of butterflies. But perhaps the word 'butterflies' is not in the index of the book, nor does it appear frequently in the text if at all (although 'rhopalocera' appears many times, being the favored word of the synonym pair). Also, on this occasion, you are interested more widely in insects. You would like your search to include butterflies but also, in part, to be a little more general. Basically, you will be disappointed with what you are able to achieve (which will be more-or-less nothing). In contrast, were the book to be digitized and it were searched by computer (either with Large Language Model, or with thesaurus support), the desired tasks and goal would be trivial and satisfiable in milliseconds. Preservation and Archiving Loss of the contents of some texts could be catastrophic for example, contracts, treaties, or the works of Shakespeare. Once digitized, once there is
