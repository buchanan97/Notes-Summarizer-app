more advanced topics. Chapter is about writing robus t, correct, and e cient programs. Chapters and cover recursion and data structures, inclu ding generic programming and the Java Collection Framework. Chapter is about les and n etworking. Chapter covers threads and parallel processing. Finally, Chapter retur ns to the topic of graphical user interface programming to cover some more advanced features . xi Preface xii Java currently has two major approaches to Graphical User In terface programming: Java FX and Swing. This edition of the textbook uses Java FX, but ther e is an alternative edition that uses Swing. The main di erences are in Chapters and , which are devoted to GUI programming, but GUI programs and GUI-related material in o ther chapters also use Java FX exclusively. For the Swing edition, much of the GUI material is taken from Version of this textbook, with some updating and modi cation. Swing is a standard part of Java. Java FX was introduced as a mo re modern approach to GUI programming, but it must be downloaded and installed sep arately from Java itself, which makes it more complicated to use. Swing and Java FX can both be used to write complex, fully functional GUI programs, and either one is a reasonable choi ce. Version of this textbook used Java FX. The alternative edition that uses Swing has been add ed for Version . GUI programming was never included in the textbook as an end i n itself, and it would take another textbook to cover the topic in its entirety. I cover G UI because it is a great example of object-oriented programming, it lets me introduce event-d riven programs,
