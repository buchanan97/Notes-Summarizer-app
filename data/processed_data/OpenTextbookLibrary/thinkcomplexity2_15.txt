recently, facilitated by the availability of cheap computation and the reluctant acceptance of subjectivity in probabilistic claims. Sharon Bertsch Mc Grayne presents this history in The Theory That Would Not Die . Objective!subjective The Enlightenment, and philosophic modernism, are based on belief in objective truth, that is, truths that are independent of the people that hold them. 20th century developments including quantum mechanics, G odel's Incompleteness Theorem, and Kuhn's study of the history of science called attention to seemingly unavoidable subjectivity in even hard sciences" and mathematics. Rebecca Goldstein presents the historical context of G odel's proof in Incompleteness . Physical law!theory!model Some people distinguish between laws, theories, and models. Calling something a law" implies that it is objectively true and immutable; theory" suggests that it is subject to revision; and model" concedes that it is a subjective choice based on simpli cations and approximations. Complexity thinking I think they are all the same thing. Some concepts that are called laws are really de nitions; others are, in e ect, the assertion that a certain model predicts or explains the behavior of a system particularly well. We come back to the nature of physical laws in Section , Section and Section . Determinism!indeterminism Determinism is the view that all events are caused, inevitably, by prior events. Forms of indeterminism include randomness, probabilistic causation, and fundamental uncertainty. We come back to this topic in Section and Section These trends are not universal or complete, but the center of opinion is shifting along these axes. As evidence, consider the reaction to Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scienti c Revolutions , which was reviled when it was published and is now considered almost
