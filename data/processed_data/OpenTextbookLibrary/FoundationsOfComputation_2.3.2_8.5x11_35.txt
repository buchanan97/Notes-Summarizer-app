by itself. This might not make grammatical sense, but it s the way mathemati cians think.) Some examples of conjunctions of simple terms would be p q,p, q, and p r w s t. Finally, we can take one or more such conjunctions and join them into a disjunction of conjunctions of simple terms. T his is the type of compound proposition we need. We can avoid some redundancy b y assuming that no propositional variable occurs more than once in a sin gle conjunction (sincep pcan be replaced by p, and ifpand pboth occur in a conjunction, then the value of the conjuction is false, and it can be elimin ated.) We can also assume that the same conjunction does not occur twice in the d isjunction. De nition . A compound proposition is said to be in disjunctive normal form, or DNF, if it is a disjunction of conjunctions of simple term s, and if, furthermore, eachpropositionalvariableoccursatmoston ceineachconjunction and each conjunction occurs at most once in the disjunction. Usingp,q,r,s,A, and Bas propositional variables, here are a few examples . APPLICATION: LOGIC CIRCUITS of propositions that are in disjunctive normal form: (p q r) (p q r s) ( p q) (p q) (A B) ( A B) p ( p q) ( p q r) ( p q r w) Propositions in DNF are just what we need to deal with input o utput tables of the type that we have been discussing. Any such table can be co mputed by a proposition in disjunctive normal form. It follows that it i s possible to build a circuit to compute that table using only and,or, andnotgates. Theorem .
