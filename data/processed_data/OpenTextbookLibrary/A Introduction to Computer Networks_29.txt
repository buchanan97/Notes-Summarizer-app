packet can be forwarded to the initial TTL value, typically . In datagram routing, a switch is responsible only for the next hop to the ultimate destination; if a switch has a complete path in mind, there is no guarantee that the next hop switch or any other downstream switch will continue to forward along that path. Misunderstandings can potentially lead to routing loops. Consider this network: B A DCB E Fig. :: Network consisting of ve nodes in a ring D might feel that the best path to B is D E C B (perhaps because it believes the A D link is to be avoided). If E similarly decides the best path to B is E D A B, and if D and E both choose their next hop for B based on these best paths, then a linear routing loop is formed: D routes to B via E and E routes to B via D. Although each of D and E have identi ed a usable path, that path is not in fact followed. Moral: successful datagram routing requires cooperation and a consistent view of the network. Congestion Switches introduce the possibility of congestion: packets arriving faster than they can be sent out. This can happen with just two interfaces, if the inbound interface has a higher bandwidth than the outbound interface; An Overview of Networks An Introduction to Computer Networks, Release another common source of congestion is traf c arriving on multiple inputs and all destined for the same output. Whatever the reason, if packets are arriving for a given outbound interface faster than they can be sent, a queue will form for that interface. Once
