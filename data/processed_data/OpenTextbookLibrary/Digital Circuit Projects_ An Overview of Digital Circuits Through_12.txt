a class in Computer Organization would need to supplement this material. The description of a CPU needs to be greatly extended for a class in Computer Organization. But the material in this text is sufficient for the reader to understand enough Boolean algebra to understand basic circuits, and how they are used in a CPU. Each subsequent chapter w ill cover one digital component. The chapter will contain an overview of the component, and a brief description of how it can be used in a CPU. For instructors who desire that students do more with the circuits than what is presented in the chapter, exer cises (both in Logisim and with the breadboards) are given at the end of each chapter. II Additional text materials This text can be downloaded from http: cupola.gettysburg.edu oer . Additional materials f or the text, including a complete parts list from commercial suppliers with part numbers and prices can be found at http: chuckkann.com . III About the second edition Other than numerous edits to fix errata in the first edition, the main reason for this new release of the text are two fold, and based on the feedback I have received from the first edition. . Chapter has been changed to provide a more theoretic background in Boolean algebra for the cases where this book is being used in a course on Computer Organization. This chapter can safely skipped by a hobbyist only interested in how digital circuits work. . The chapter in the first edition was intended to give a context for the ICs developed in this text. It seemed o ut of place and disjointed from the rest of the text.
