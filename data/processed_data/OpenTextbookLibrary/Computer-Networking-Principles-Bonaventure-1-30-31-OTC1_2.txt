of the information that is available for different topics. The second reason is that the computer networking community is a strong participant in the open-source movement. Today, there are high-quality and widely used open-source implementations for most networking protocols. This includes the TCP IP implementations that are part of linux, freebsd or the u IPstack running on 8bits controllers, but also servers such as bind, unbound, apache orsendmail and implementations of routing protocols such asxorp orquagga . Furthermore, the documents that de ne almost all of the Internet protocols have been developed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) using an open process. The IETF publishes its protocol speci cations in the publicly available RFC and new proposals are described in Internet drafts. This open textbook aims to ll the gap between the open-source implementations and the open-source network speci cations by providing a detailed but pedagogical description of the key principles that guide the operation of the Internet. The book is released under a creative commons licence. Such an open-source license is motivated by two reasons. The rst is that we hope that this will allow many students to use the book to learn computer networks. The second is that I hope that other teachers will reuse, adapt and improve it. Time will tell if it is possible to build a community of contributors to improve and develop the book further. As a starting point, the rst release contains all the material for a one-semester rst upper undergraduate or a graduate networking course. As of this writing, most of the text has been written by Olivier Bonaventure. Laurent Vanbever, Virginie Van den Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org courses cs402 The
