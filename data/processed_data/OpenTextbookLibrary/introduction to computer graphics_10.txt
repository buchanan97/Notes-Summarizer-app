While it is not possible to cover the entire eld in a rst course or even a large part of it this should be a good place to start.

Painting and Drawing The main focus of this book is three-dimensional ( D) graphics, where most of the w ork goes into producing a D model of a scene. But ultimately, in a lmost all cases, the end result of a computer graphics project is a two-dimensional image. And of course, the direct production and manipulation of D images is an important topic in its own right. Furthermore, a lot of ideas carry over from two dimensions to three. So, it makes se nse to start with graphics in D. Animagethatispresentedonthecomputerscreenismadeupof pixels. Thescreenconsists of a rectangular grid of pixels, arranged in rows and columns . The pixels are small enough that they are not easy to see individually. In fact, for many very h igh-resolution displays, they become essentially invisible. At a given time, each pixel ca n show only one color. Most screens these days use -bit color, where a color can be speci ed by t hree -bit numbers, giving the levels of red, green, and blue in the color. Any color that can be shown on the screen is made up of some combination of these three primary colors. Othe r formats are possible, such as grayscale , where each pixel is some shade of gray and the pixel color is g iven by
