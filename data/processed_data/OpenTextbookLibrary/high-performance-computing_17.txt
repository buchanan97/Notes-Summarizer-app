we must still use the slower memory technology . Caches Once we go beyond the registers in the memory hierarchy , we encounter caches. Caches are small amounts of SRAM that store a subset of the contents of the memory . The hope is that the cache will have the right subset of main memory at the right time. The actual cache architecture has had to change as the cycle time of the processors has improved. The processors are so fast that of f-chip SRAM chips are not even fast enough. This has lead to a multilevel cache approach with one, or even two, levels of cache implemented as part of the processor . link shows the approximate speed of accessing the memory hierarchy on a -MHz DEC Alpha. Memory Access Speed on a DEC Alpha Registers ns L1 On-Chip ns L2 On-Chip ns L3 Of f-Chip ns Memory ns When every reference can be found in a cache, you say that you have a hit rate. Generally , a hit rate of or better is considered good for a level-one (L1) cache. In level-two (L2) cache, a hit rate of above is considered acceptable. Below that, application performance can drop of f steeply . One can characterize the average read performance of the memory hierarchy by examining the probability that a particular load will be satisfied at a particular level of the hierarchy . For example, assume a memory architecture with an L1 cache speed of ns, L2 speed of ns, and memory speed of ns. If a memory reference were satisfied from L1 cache of the time, L2 cache of the time, and main memory of the time,
