of Sir Thomas Moore we would have the playscript in digital form. But the playscript itself is in letters, words, sentences, and in speeches. It has structure. It is that structure, or some or most of it, that we would like captured digital form. When Google set out on their book project, they did not aim to photograph every page of every book. They aimed to use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to get to the structured text in digital form as 0s and 1s. They aimed to transcribe to digitized computer text that could be copied, pasted, read aloud, translated to other languages, etc. It is that structured digitization that is the desired goal. ML can usually work with a digital image of a text and do an OCR extraction of structured text. But, nowadays, when authors are writing on word processors, and publishers are using the digitized form throughout the workflow, structured digitization should be available without having use OCR on images. Many libraries have digital collections, for example the Library of Congress has https: www.loc.gov collections with millions and millions of items. Its collection Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers has over million images (i.e. photographs) of pages of historical newspapers. That is great, but for certain kinds of research those need to be transcribed into the 0s and 1s of computer text. (Very shortly machine learning will be able to do that task in the blink of an eye.) A Paean to Text in Structured Digital Form Having text in digital form is very valuable in terms of what can be done with it. Here are some possibilities. (There may be some overlap between the categories.) Text-to-Speech (Computer)
