maps are concerned with showing how one or more geographical aspects are distributed across space. Dynamic maps refer to maps that are changeable and often require user interaction. The democratization of maps and mapping is increasing access, use, and appreciation for all types of maps, as well as driving map innovations. EXE RCISES .

The objective of this section is to describe and discuss the concepts of map scale, coordinate systems, and map projections and explain why they are central to maps, mapping, and geographic information systems (GISs). All map users and map viewers have certain expectations about what is contained on a map. Such expectations are formed and learned from previous experience by working with maps. It is important to note that such expec tations also change with increased exposure to maps. Understanding and meeting the expectations of map viewers is a challenging but necessary task because such expectations provide a starting point for the creation of any map. The central purpose of a map is to provide relevant and useful information to the map user.
