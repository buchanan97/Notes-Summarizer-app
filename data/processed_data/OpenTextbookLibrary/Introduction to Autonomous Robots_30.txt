ones, often based on preferences in the various different fields, such as aviation or geology, that these algorithms and products originally catered to. There is a fundamental caveat with all of the above approaches: each of the rotation matrices can look like subsequent rotations around the same axis for certain values of angles. For example, this happens for the XYZ rotation matrix if the angle of rotation around the Y-axis is . These cases are known as a singularities of the specific notation. We therefore need additional representations that work across the entire range of possible motions. Quaternions . Locomotion, manipulation and their representations Among the many possible conventions, the preferred representation for computational and stability reasons are quaternions . A quaternion is a -tuple that extends the complex numbers with very general applications in mathematics and representing orientation and rotation in particular. Quaternions are generally represented in the form q a bi cj dk ( ) Here, ais referred to the scalar part of the Quaternion and the elements b, canddas the vector part. A Quaternion s conjugate is given by q a bi cj dk ( ) It can be shown that that each rotation can be represented as a rotation around a single axis (a vector in space) by a specific angle, also known as Euler axis. Given such an axis K kxkykz Tand an angle , one can calculate the so-called Euler parameters or unit quaternion q ( 1, 2, 3, 4) with 1 cos ( ) 2 kxsin ( ) 3 kysin ( ) 4 kzsin ( ) These four quantities are constrained by the relationship 2 2 2 2 , ( ) which might
