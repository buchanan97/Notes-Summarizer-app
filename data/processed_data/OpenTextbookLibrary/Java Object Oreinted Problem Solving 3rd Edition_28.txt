The actions that are associated with an object can be used to send messages to the objects and to retrieve information from objects. A message is the passing of information or data from one object to another. Figure illustrates how this works. In UML, messages are represented by arrows. SECTION What Is Object-Oriented Programming? Figure : Messages in UML are represented by labeled arrows. In this example, we are telling a pawn to move from its current position to row column . In this example, we are telling pawn1:Chess Piece tomove To( , ) . The numbers and in this case are arguments that tell the pawn what square to move to. (A chess board has rows and columns and each square is identi ed by its row and column coordinates.) In general, an argument is a data value that specializes the content of a message in some way. In this example we are telling the pawn to move forward by row. If we wanted the pawn to move forward by rows, we would send the message move To( , ) . The diagram in Figure depicts a sequence of messages representing an idealized ATM transaction. First, an ATM customer asks the ATM machine to report his current balance. The ATM machine in turn asks the customer s bank account to report the customer s balance. The ATM receives the value from the bank account and passes it along to the customer. In this case, the message does not involve an argument. But it does involve a result. A result is information or data that is returned to the object that sent the message.
