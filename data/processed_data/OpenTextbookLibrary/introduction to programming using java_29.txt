between the integer and the oating-point number ; they actually look quite di ere nt inside the computer.) There could also be types for individual characters ( A , ; , etc.), st rings ( Hello , A string can include many characters , etc.), and less common types such as dates , colors, sounds, or any other kind of data that a program might need to store. Programming languages always have commands for getting dat a into and out of variables and for doing computations with data. For example, the follo wing assignment statement, which might appear in a Java program, tells the computer to ta ke the number stored in the variable named principal , multiply that number by , a nd then store the result in the variable named interest : interest principal ; There are also input commands for getting data from the use r or from les on the computer s disks, and there are output commands for sending data in th e other direction. These basic commands for moving data from place to place and for performing computations are the building blocks for all programs. The se building blocks are combined CHAPTER . THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE into complex programs using control structures and subrout ines. A program is a sequence of instructions. In the ordinary ow of control, the computer executes the instructions in the sequence in which they occu r in the program, one after the other. However, this is obviously very limited: the compute r would soon run out of instructions to execute. Control structures are special instructions that can change the ow of control. There are two basic types of control
