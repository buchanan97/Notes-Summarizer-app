probably have to redo your hypothesis building and testing). The real problem occurs when your experiment gives you the desired result, Q. Logically speaking, (H!Q)and Q doesn t tell you anything about whether His true or not! There are many ways your hypothesis could be wrong or insuf cient even if the predicted outcome was obtained in the experiment. For example, maybe another alternative hypothesis Rcould be the right one ( R!P,R!Q), or maybe Hwould need an additional condition Kto predict Pand Q(Hand K!P,Hand K!Q) but you were not aware of the existence of K. Let me give you a concrete example. One morning, you looked outside and found that your lawn was wet (observation P). Y ou hypothesized that it must have rained while you were asleep (hypothesis H), which perfectly explains your observation ( H!P). Then you predicted that, if it rained overnight, the driveway next door must also be wet (prediction Qthat satis es H!Q). Y ou went out to look and, indeed, it was also wet (if not,Hwould be clearly wrong). Now, think about whether this new observation really proves your hypothesis that it rained overnight. If you think critically, you should be able to come up with other scenarios in which both your lawn and the driveway next door could be wet without having a rainy night. Maybe the humidity in the air was unusually high, so the condensation in the early morning made the ground wet everywhere. Or maybe a re hydrant by the street got hit by a car early that morning and it burst open, wetting the nearby area. There could be many other potential explanations for your observation. In sum, obtaining
