Paint Oval(r: Rect); procedure Erase Oval(r: Rect); procedure Invert Oval(r: Rect); procedure Fill Oval(r: Rect; pat: Pattern); Each one inscribes an oval in an aligned rectangle r (sides parallel to the axes) so as to touch the four sides of r. If r is a square, the oval becomes a circle. We quote from App : Algorithms and Data Structures A Global Text . Graphics primitives and environments Frame Oval draws an outline just inside the oval that fits inside the specified rectangle, using the current graf Port's pen pattern, mode, and size. The outline is as wide as the pen width and as tall as the pen height. It's drawn with the pn Pat, according to the pattern transfer mode specified by pn Mode. The pen location is not changed by this procedure. Right away we notice a trade-off when comparing Quick Draw to the simple turtle graphics environment we introduced earlier. At one stroke, Frame Oval appears to be able to produce many different pictures, but before we can exploit this power, we have to learn about graf Ports, pen width, pen height, pen patterns, and pattern transfer modes. 'Frame Oval' draws the perimeter of an oval, 'Paint Oval' paints the interior as well, 'Erase Oval' paints an oval with the current graf Port's background pattern, 'Invert Oval' complements the pixels: 'white' becomes 'black', and vice versa. 'Fill Oval' has an additional argument that specifies a pen pattern used for painting the interior. We may not need to know all of this in order to use one of these procedures, but we do need to know how to specify a rectangle. Quick Draw has predefined a type 'Rect'
