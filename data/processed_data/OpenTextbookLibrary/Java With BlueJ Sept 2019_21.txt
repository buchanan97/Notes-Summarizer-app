true false true true false false true false true false false false false false false The following table gives some example boolean expressions. The last examples are complex expres sions. To understand those evaluations we need to know Java rules for evaluating these expressions (discussed in the notes below). boolean x, y, z; x false ; y true ; z true ; example result y true y z true x y true ! x true x y ! z false ! x y true ! (x y) false A Boolean expression may have multiple operators. Consider example from above, x y ! z Java assigns priorities to Boolean operators: ! is highest, followed by , followed by . Higher priority ope rators are evaluated before lower priority operators. So, for the above expression !z is evaluated first yielding false. So now the expression effectively becomes: x y false As has higher priority than it is evaluated next yielding false . So now the expression effectively becomes: false false which evaluates to false. sub-expressions Sub-expressions are enclosed in parentheses. A sub -expression is evaluated before the expression of which it is a part, and that value is substituted in its place. Consider examples and from above. They are the same except for the use of parentheses. In example : ! x y the ! is evaluated first , and the expression effectively becomes: true y which evaluates to true. In example : ! (x y) the sub-expression (x y) is evaluated first, and then ! is evaluated. Since x y evaluates to true , the result for the expression is false . Some further points about the Boolean operators (not very
