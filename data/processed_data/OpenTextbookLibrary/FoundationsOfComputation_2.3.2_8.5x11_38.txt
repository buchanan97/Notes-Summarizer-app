input outpu t behavior. As a practical matter, we will usually prefer the circuit that is simpler. The correspondence between circuits and propositions allows us to ap ply Boolean algebra to the simpli cation of circuits. For example, consider the DNF proposition corresponding to the table in Figure1. . In ( p q r) ( p q r) (p q r), we can factor ( q r) from the last two terms, giving ( p q r) (( p p) (q r)). Since p p T, and T Q Qfor any proposition Q, this can be simpli ed to ( p q r) (q r). Again, we can apply the distributive law to this to factor out anr, giving (( p q) q) r). This compound proposition is logically equivalent to the one we started with, but implementing it in a circuit requires only ve logic gates, instead of the ten required by the origi nal proposition. If you start with a circuit instead of a proposition, it is oft en possible to nd t
