Relationships and are known as De Morgan's Law s, and should simply be memorized. Applying these relationships for f1(A,B,C), we find the following: DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS f1(A,B,C) AB'C' AB'C ABC' ABC AB'(C' C) AB(C' C) (rule ) AB'( ) AB( ) (rule ) AB' AB (rule ) A(B' B) (rule ) A( ) (rule ) A (rule ) This expression is obviously simpler than the original, and the number of gates needed for this circuit has been reduced from to . This reduction was obviously worth the effort. But how did we know to continue to reduce this expression after "AB' AB"? This was a significant reduction in itself, form to gates. Since we have now shown that DNF does not necessarily (and often does not) result in a minimum expression, how can we know if a minimum expression has been reached? That is the topic of the next section of this chapter. Karnaugh Maps (K-maps) Karnaugh Map s (K-maps) are a mechanism for creating minimum Boolean expressions from a truth table . K-maps rely on Gray Code s to create the mapping space, so this chapter will first cover Gray Codes. The chapter will continue w ith how to set up a K -map, how to solve a
