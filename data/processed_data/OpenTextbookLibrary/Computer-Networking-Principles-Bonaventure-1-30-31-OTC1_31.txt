common representation of the data transferred. The ASN. notation was designed for the Presentation layer and is still used today by some protocols. the Application layer that contains the mechanisms that do not t in neither the Presentation nor the Session layer. The OSI Application layer was itself further divided in several generic service elements. Note: Where are the missing layers in TCP IP reference model ? The TCP IP reference places the Presentation and the Session layers implicitly in the Application layer. The main motivations for simplifying the upper layers in the TCP IP reference model were pragmatic. Most Internet applications started as prototypes that evolved and were later standardised. Many of these applications assumed that they would be used to exchange information written in American English and for which the bits US-ASCII character code was suf cient. This was the case for email, but as we ll see in the next chapter, email was able to evolve to support different character encodings. Some applications considered the different data representations explicitly. For example, ftpcontained mechanisms to convert a le from one format to another and the HTML language was de ned to represent web pages. On the other hand, many ISO speci cations were developed by committees composed of people who did not all participate in actual implementations. ISO spent a lot of effort analysing the requirements and de ning a solution that meets all of these requirements. Unfortunately, some of the speci cations were so complex that it was dif cult to implement them completely and the standardisation bodies de ned recommended pro les that contained the implemented sets of options Figure : The seven layers of the
