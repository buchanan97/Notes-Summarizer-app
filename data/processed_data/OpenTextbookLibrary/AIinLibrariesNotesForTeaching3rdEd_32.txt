pair is better and which worse. Then, those evaluations will be fed back to the model as additional training. The model will adjust itself accordingly. One point of importance about RLHFs is that as the models get really big, as they are going to, RLHF becomes impossible as a practicality. If a model were to produce a billion responses, no human jury would be able to evaluate them. In 2024, RLHF has been one difference between success and failure with Foundation Models. But it is not going to work in its present form going forward. There are plenty of companies advertising on the Internet for (paid) RLHF jury participants. Try advertisements for RLHF participants in a Google or Perplexity search. The Concept of Algorithm Programmers, mathematicians, and computer scientists regard algorithms as finite sequences of steps or instructions to perform a comp
