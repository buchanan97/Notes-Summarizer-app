Winston2003 , Apple bet on Appletalk SAO1990 . In the research community, ARPANET was decommissioned and replaced by TCP IP LCCD09 and the reference implementation was developed inside BSD Unix Mc Kusick1999 . Universities who were already running Unix could thus adopt TCP IP easily and vendors of Unix workstations such as Sun or Silicon Graphics included TCP IP in their variant of Unix. In parallel, the ISO, with support from the governments, worked on developing an open Suite of networking protocols. In the end, TCP IP became the de facto standard that is not only used within the research community. During the 1990s and the early 2000s, the growth of the usage of TCP IP continued, and today proprietary protocols are seldom used. As shown by the gure below, that provides the estimation of the number of hosts attached to the Internet, the Internet has sustained large growth throughout the last years. Figure : Estimation of the number of hosts on the Internet Open in ISO terms was in contrast with the proprietary protocol suites whose speci cation was not always publicly available. The US government even mandated the usage of the OSI protocols (see RFC 1169), but this was not suf cient to encourage all users to switch to the OSI protocol suite that was considered by many as too complex compared to other protocol suites.

However, although the number of hosts attached to the Internet is high, it should be compared to the
