surface interacts with light that hits the surface. Material proper ties can include a basic color as well as other properties such as shininess, roughness, and trans parency. One of the most useful kinds of material property is a texture. In most general terms, a texture is a way of varying material properties from point- to-point on a surface. The most common use of texture is to allow di erent colors for di eren t points. This is often done by using a D image as a texture. The image can be applied to a surf ace so that the image looks like it is painted onto the surface. However, texture can a lso refer to changing values for things like transparency or bumpiness. Textures allow us to add detail to a scene without using a huge number of geometric primitives; instead, you ca n use a smaller number of textured primitives. A material is an intrinsic property of an object, but the actu al appearance of the object also depends on the environment in which the object is viewed . In the real world, you don t see anything unless there is some light in the environment. T he same is true in D graphics: you have to add simulated lighting to a scene. There can be several sources of light in a scene. Each light source can have its own color, intensity, a nd direction or position. The light from those sources will then interact with the material prop erties of the objects in the scene. Support for lighting in a graphics system can range from fair ly simple to very complex and computationally intensive. Finally, the image
