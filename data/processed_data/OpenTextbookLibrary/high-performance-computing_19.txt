or all other processors must be made aware of local cache activity . Perhaps they need to be told to invalidate old lines containing the previous value of the written variable so that they don t accidentally use stale data. This is known as maintaining coher ency between the dif ferent caches. The problem can become very complex in a multiprocessor system. footnote link describes cache coherency in more detail. Caches are ef fective because programs often exhibit characteristics that help kep the hit rate high. These characteristics are called spatial and temporal locality of r eference; programs often make use of instructions and data that are near to other instructions and data, both in space and time. When a cache line is retrieved from main memory , it contains not only the information that caused the cache miss, but also some neighboring information. Chances are good that the next time your program needs data, it will be in the cache line just fetched or another one recently fetched. Caches work best when a program is reading sequentially through the memory . Assume a program is reading -bit integers with a cache line size of bits. When the program references the first word in the cache line, it waits while the cache line is loaded from main memory . Then the next seven references to memory are satisfied quickly from the cache. This is called unit stride because the address of each successive data element is incremented by one and all the data retrieved into the cache is used. The following loop is a unit-stride loop: DO I ,1000000 SUM SUM A(I) END DO When a program accesses a lar
