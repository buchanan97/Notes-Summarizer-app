understand. Then you can start rebuilding. Beginning programmers sometimes get stuck on one of these activities and forget the others. Finding a hard bug requires reading, running, ruminating, and sometimes retreating. If you get stuck on one of these activities, try the others. Each activity comes with its own failure mode. For example, reading your code might help if the problem is a typographical error, but not if the problem is a conceptual misunderstanding. If you don t understand what your program does, you can read it times and never see the error, because the error is in your head. Running experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests. But if you run experiments without thinking or reading your code, you might fall into a pattern I call random walk programming , which is the process of making random changes until the program does the right thing. Needless to say, random walk programming can take a long time. You have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental science. You should have at least one hypothesis about what the problem is. If there are two o r more possibilities, try to think of a test that would eliminate one of them. Taking a break helps with the thinking. So does talking. If you explain the problem to someone else (or even to yourself), you will sometimes nd the answer before you nish asking the question. . THE LEARNING JOURNEY But even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many errors, or if the code you are trying to x is too big and complicated. Sometimes the best option is to retreat, simplifying the
