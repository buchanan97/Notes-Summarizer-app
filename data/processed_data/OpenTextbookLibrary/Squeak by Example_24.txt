De ning a new method The advent of Test Driven Development4has changed the way that we write code. The idea behind Test Driven Development, also called TDD Kent Beck, Test Driven Development: By Example . Addison-Wesley, 2003, ISBN 14653 . A quick tour of Squeak Figure : Finding a method by example. or Behaviour Driven Development, is that we write a test that de nes the desired behaviour of our code before we write the code itself. Only then do we write the code that satis es the test. Suppose that our assignment is to write a method that says something loudly and with emphasis . What exactly could that mean? What would be a good name for such a method? How can we make sure that programmers who may have to maintain our method in the future have an unambiguous description of what it should do? We can answer all of these questions by giving an example: When we send the message shout to the string Don t panic the result should be DON T PANIC! . To make this example into something that the system can use, we turn it into a test method: Method : A test for a shout method test Shout self assert: ('Don''t panic' shout 'DON''T PANIC!') How do we create a new method in Squeak? First, we have to decide which class the method should belong to. In this case, the shout method that
