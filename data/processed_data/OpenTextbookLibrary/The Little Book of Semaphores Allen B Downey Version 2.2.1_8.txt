what this book is about: software techniques for enfo rcing synchronization constraints. Execution model In order to understand software synchronization, you have t o have a model of how computer programs run. In the simplest model, computers execute one instruction after another in sequence. In this model, synch ronization is trivial; we can tell the order of events by looking at the program. If St atement A comes before Statement B, it will be executed rst. Introduction There are two ways things get more complicated. One possibil ity is that the computer is parallel, meaning that it has multiple proce ssors running at the same time. In that case it is not easy to know if a statement on o ne processor is executed before a statement on another. Another possibility is that a single processor is running mu ltiple threads of execution. A thread is a sequence of instructions that execu te sequentially. If there are multiple threads, then the processor can work on on e for a while, then switch to another, and so on. In general the programmer has no control over when each threa d runs; the operating system (speci cally, the scheduler) makes those decisions. As a result, again, the programmer can t tell when statements in di eren t threads will be executed. For purposes of synchronization, there is no di erence betw een the parallel model and the multithread model. The issue is the same within one processor (or one thread) we know the order of execution, but between pr ocessors (or threads) it is impossible to tell. A real world example might make this clearer.
