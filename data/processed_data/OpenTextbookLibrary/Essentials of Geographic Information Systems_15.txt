This movement and, in particular, destination -oriented travel are generally referred to as navigation. How we navigate through space is a complex pro cess that blends together our various motor skills; technology; mental maps; and awareness of locations, distances, directions, and the space where we live (Golledge and Stimson 1997). What is more, our geographical knowledge and spatial awareness is c ontinuously updated and changed as we move from one location to another. The acquisition of geographic knowledge is a lifelong endeavor. Though several factors influence the nature of such knowledge, we tend to rely on the three following types of geograph ic knowledge when navigating through space: . Landmark knowledge refers to our ability to locate and identify unique points, patterns, or features (e.g., landmarks) in space. . Route knowledge permits us to connect and travel between landmarks by moving throug h space. . Survey knowledge enables us to understand where landmarks are in relation to each other and to take shortcuts. Each type of geographic knowledge is acquired in stages, one after the other. For instance, when we find ourselves in a new or an unfami liar location, we usually identify a few unique points of interest (e.g., hotel, building, fountain) to orient ourselves. We are in essence building up our landmark knowledge. Using and traveling between these landmarks develops our route knowledge and rei nforces our landmark knowledge and our overall geographical awareness. Survey knowledge develops once we begin to
