throughput . Data rates are generally measured in kilobits per second (kbps) or megabits per second (Mbps); the use of the lower-case b here denotes bits. In the context of data rates, a kilobit is 103bits (not ) and a megabit is 106bits. Somewhat inconsistently, we follow the tradition of using k B and MB to denote data volumes of 210and 220bytes respectively, with the upper-case B denoting bytes. The newer abbreviations Ki B and Mi B would be more precise, but the consequences of confusion are modest. Packets Packets are modest-sized sequences of bytes, transmitted as a unit through some shared set of links. Of necessity, packets need to be pre xed with a header containing delivery information. In the common case known as datagram forwarding , the header contains a destination address ; headers in networks using socalled virtual-circuit forwarding contain instead an identi er for the connection . Almost all networking today (and for the past years) is packet-based, although we will later look brie y at some circuitswitched options for voice telephony. At the LAN layer, packets can be viewed as the imposition of a buffer (and addressing) structure on top of low-level serial lines; additional layers then impose additional structure. Informally, packets are often referred to as frames at the LAN layer, and as segments at the Transport layer. The maximum packet size supported by a given LAN ( eg Ethernet, Token Ring or ATM) is an intrinsic attribute of that LAN. Ethernet allows a maximum of 1500 bytes of data. By comparison, TCP IP packets originally often held only bytes of data, while early Token Ring packets could contain up to k B of
