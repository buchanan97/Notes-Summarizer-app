need to note is that the contents of this book are focused on dynamical models, and as such, they are not intended to cover all aspects of complex systems science. There are many important topics that are not included in the text because of the limitation of space and time. For example, topics that involve probability, stochasticity, and statistics, such as information theory, entropy, complexity measurement, stochastic models, statistical analysis, and machine learning, are not discussed much in this book. Fortunately, there are several excellent textbooks on these topics already available. xii This textbook was made possible, thanks to the help and support of a number of people. I would like to rst express my sincere gratitude to Ken Mc Leod, the former Chair of the Department of Bioengineering at Binghamton University, who encouraged me to write this textbook. The initial brainstorming discussions I had with him helped me tremendously in shaping the basic topics and structure of this book. After all, it was Ken who hired me at Binghamton, so I owe him a lot anyway. Thank you Ken. My thanks also go to Y aneer Bar-Y am, the President of the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI), where I did my postdoctoral studies (alas, way more than a decade ago time ies). I was professionally introduced to the vast eld of complex systems by him, and the various research projects I worked on under his guidance helped me learn many of the materials discussed in this book. He also gave me the opportunity to teach complex systems modeling at the NECSI Summer Winter Schools. This ongoing teaching experience has helped me a lot in the development of the
