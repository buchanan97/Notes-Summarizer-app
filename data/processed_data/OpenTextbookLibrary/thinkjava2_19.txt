message after the Hello, World!. Say something witty like,How are you?. Compile and run the program again. Exercises . Add a comment to the program (anywhere), recompile, and run it again. The new comment should not affect the result. This exercise may seem trivial, but it is the starting place for many of the programs we will work with. To debug with confidence, you will need to have confidence in your programming environment. In some environments, it is easy to lose track of which program is executing. Youmightfindyourselftryingtodebugoneprogramwhileyouareaccidentally running another. Adding (and changing) print statements is a simple way to be sure that the program you are looking at is the program you are running. Exercise It is a good idea to commit as many errors as you can think of, so that you see what error messages the compiler produces. Sometimes the compiler tells you exactly what is wrong, and all you have to do is fix it. But sometimes the error messages are misleading. Over time you will develop a sense for when you can trust the compiler and when you have to figure things out yourself. Starting with the Hello World program, try out each of the following errors. After you make each change, compile the program, read the error message (if there is one), and then fix the error. . Remove one of the opening curly braces. . Remove one of the closing curly braces. . Instead ofmain, writemian. . Remove the wordstatic. . Remove the wordpublic. . Remove the word System. . Replaceprintlnwith Println. . Replaceprintlnwithprint. . Delete one parenthesis. . Add an extra parenthesis. Chapter Computer Programming Chapter Variables and Operators This chapter describes
