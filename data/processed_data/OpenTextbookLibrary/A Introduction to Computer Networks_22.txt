to its nal destination. The next hop value in a forwarding table is a single entry; each switch is responsible for only one step in the packet s path. However, if all is well, the network of switches will be able to deliver the packet, one hop at a time, to its ultimate destination. The destination entries in the forwarding table do not have to correspond exactly with the packet destination addresses, though in the examples here they do, and they do for Ethernet datagram forwarding. However, for IP routing, the table destination entries will correspond to pre xes of IP addresses; this leads to a huge savings in space. The fundamental requirement is that the switch can perform a lookup operation, using its forwarding table and the destination address in the arriving packet, to determine the next hop. Just how the forwarding table is built is a question for later; we will return to this for Ethernet switches in Ethernet Learning Algorithm and for IP routers in Routing-Update Algorithms . For now, the forwarding tables may be thought of as created through initial con guration. In the gure below, switch S1 has interfaces , and , and S2 has interfaces , , , . If A is to send a packet to B, S1 must have a forwarding-table entry indicating that destination B is reached via its interface , and S2 must have an entry forwarding the packet out on interface .
