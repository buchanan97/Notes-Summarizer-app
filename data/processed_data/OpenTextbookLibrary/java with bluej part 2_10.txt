array looking for the required element. The process examines the middle element and determines if the required element is above or below the middle element; then the process continues on that subset of the array where the required element may be present. The process continues until the required value is found or there is nothing left to examine. .fill() : Assigns a speci ed value to every element of an array. CHAPTER . ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS Example Sorting and searching an array The interested student is referred to the Java Class Library documentation for complete information regarding Arrays. Here, we demonstrate how one can sort an array and then search the array for a speci c entry. Consider that we have an array of names. To simplify we shall initialize the array in the code. The program prompts the user for a name, performs a search, and then responds accordingly. Following the listing there are some remarks.
