programming languages are formal languages. token: One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program, analogous to a word in a natural language. parse: To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure. print statement: An instruction that causes the Python interpreter to display a value on the screen. The way of the program Chapter Variables, expressions and statements Values and types Avalue is one of the fundamental things like a letter or a number that a program manipulates. The values we have seen so far are (the result when we added1 ), and Hello, World! . These values belong to di erent types :2is an integer, and Hello, World! is astring , so-called because it contains a string of letters. You (and the interpreter) can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks. The print statement also works for integers. print If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you. type( Hello, World! ) type str type( ) type int Not surprisingly, strings belong to the type strand integers belong to the type int. Less obviously, numbers with a decimal point belong to a type called float , because these numbers are represented in a format called oating-point . Variables, expressions and statements type( ) type float What about values like and ? They look like numbers, but they are in quotation marks like strings. type( ) type str type( ) type str They re strings. When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of three digits, as in , , . This is not a legal integer in Python, but it
