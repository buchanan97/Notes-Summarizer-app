numbers. If the arrays represent information for the same set of students then we would want to arrange that the ith element of the name array and the ithelement of the number array are for the same student. Example Parallel arrays: student names and numbers Consider the following where two arrays hold information for students: one array of names and the other an array of student numbers. For simplicity we initialize the arrays inline. The program prompts the user for a student number and displays the student's name. In order to get the name of the student the program goes through all the elements of number and when it nds a number matching the input, it displays the corresponding name in the other array. Listing : Finding information in parallel arrays. 1import java . util . Scanner ; Student information is in two arrays . Find student number and report name . 6public class Student Info public static void main ( String args ) String name "Joe"," Linda "," Mary "," Peter ","Lee" ; int number , , , , ; Scanner kb new Scanner ( System .in); System . out . println (" Enter student number : "); int to Find kb. next Int (); for (int i ; i number . length ; i ) if ( to Find number i ) System . out. println ( name i ); . PARALLEL ARRAYS This program performs what is usually called a search operation: scanning an array looking for a speci c element. The program as it was written always iterates through the whole number array; normally a programmer would stop the iteration once the element has been found
