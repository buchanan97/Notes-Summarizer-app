. The sentence says something about its subject. The subject of Grass is green is grass. The sen tence says something about grass. The something that the sentence says about its subject is the predicate. In the example, the predicate is the phrase i s green. Once we start working with predicates, we can create proposition s usingquanti ers like all, some, and no. For example, working with the p redicate is above average, we can move from simple propositions like Johnny is above average to All children are above average or to No child is above av erage or to the rather more realistic Some children are above average. Lo gical deduction usually deals with quanti ed statements, as shown by the basic e xample of human mortality with which we began this chapter. Logical deducti on will be a major topic of this chapter; under the name of proof, it will be the last major topic of this chapter, and a major tool for the rest of this book. Propositional Logic A proposition is a statement which is either true or false. In propositional logic, we take propositions as basic and see what we can do with them. Since this is mathematics, we need to be able to talk about propositions without saying which particular propositions we are talking about, so we us e symbolic names to represent them. We will always use lowercase letters such asp,q, andr to represent propositions. A letter used in this way is calle d apropositional variable . Remember that when I say something like Let pbe a proposition, I mean For the rest of this discussion, let the symbol pstand for some
