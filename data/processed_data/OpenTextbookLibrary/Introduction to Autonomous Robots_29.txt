three values are sufficient to describe orientation. This becomes clear when considering that orthogonality (dot product of all columns is zero) and vector length (each vector must have length ) impose six constraints on the nine values in the rotation matrix. Indeed, an orientation can be represented as a rotation by certain angles around the x, the y, and the z-axis of the reference coordinate system. This is known as the X-Y-Z fixedangle notation. Mathematically, this can be represented by a rotation matrix of the form: A BRXY Z( , , ) hcos sin 0 sin cos 0 1i cos sin sin 0 cos cos sin sin cos ( ) While the X-Y-Z fixed angles approach expresses a coordinate frame using rotations with respect to the original coordinate frame (say, A ), another possible description is to start with a coordinate frame B that is coincident with frame A , then rotate around the Z-axis with angle , then the Y-axis with angle and finally around the X-axis with angle . This representation is called Z-Y-X Euler angles. As the coordinate axis do not necessarily need to be different, there are twelve possible valid combinations of sub-sequent rotations: XYX, XZX, YXY, YZY, ZXZ, ZYZ, XYZ, XZY, YZX, YXZ, ZXY and ZYX. The reason for which there are only twelve is that sub-sequent rotations around the same axis are not valid. Such rotations would not add any information, but are equivalent to a rotation by the sum of both angles. It is important to understand the subtle differences between the available transformations as there is neither right nor wrong convention, however different manufacturers of hardware and software products might use different
