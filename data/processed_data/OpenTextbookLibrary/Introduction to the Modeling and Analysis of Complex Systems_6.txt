to the big ideas and key take-home messages about complex systems. In the meantime, one persistent challenge I have been having in teaching complex systems over the last several years is the apparent lack of accessible, easy-to-follow, introductory-level technical textbooks. What I mean by technical textbooks are the ones that get down to the wet and dirty details of how to build mathematical or computational models of complex systems and how to simulate and analyze them. Other books that go into such levels of detail are typically written for advanced students who are already doing some kind of research in physics, mathematics, or computer science. What I needed, instead, was a technical textbook that would be more appropriate for a broader audience college freshmen and sophomores in any science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas, undergraduate graduate students in other majors, such as the social sciences, management organizational sciences, health sciences and the humanities, and even advanced high school students looking for research projects who are ix x interested in complex systems modeling. This Open SUNY textbook is my humble attempt to meet this need. As someone who didn t major in either physics or mathematics, and who moved away from the mainstream of computer science, I thought I could be a good translator of technical material for laypeople who don t major in those quantitative elds. To make the material as tangible as possible, I included a lot of step-by-step instructions on how to develop models (especially computer simulation codes), as well as many visuals, in this book. Those detailed instructions visuals may sometimes look a bit redundant, but hopefully they will make the technical material more accessible to
