ould kno w p(Bj D) . I included the Mon t y Hall problem in this c hapter b ecause I think it is fun, and b ecause Ba y es's theorem mak es the complexit y of the problem a little more manageable. But it is not a t ypical use of Ba y es's theorem, so if y ou found it confusing, don't w orry! Discussion F or man y problems in v olving conditional probabilit y , Ba y es's theorem provides a divide-and-conquer strategy . If p(Aj B) is hard to compute, or hard to measure exp erimen tally , c hec k whether it migh t b e easier to compute the other terms in Ba y es's theorem, p(Bj A) ,p(A) andp(B) . If the Mon t y Hall problem is y our idea of fun, I ha v e collected a n umb er of similar problems in an article called All y our Ba y es are b elong to us, whic h y ou can read at http: allendowney.blogspot.com 2011 all- your- bayes- are- belong- to- us.html . Chapter Computational Statistics Distributions In statistics a distribution is a set of v alues and their corresp onding probabilities. F or example, if y ou roll a six-sided die, the set of p ossible v alues is the n um b ers to , and the probabilit y asso ciated with eac h v alue is .
