rst pregnancy is , for the second pregnancy is , and so on. birthord is a serial number for live births; the code for a respondent's rst child is , and so on. For outcomes other than live birth, this eld is blank. birthwgt lb andbirthwgt oz contain the pounds and ounces parts of the birth weight of the baby. agepreg is the mother's age at the end of the pregnancy. finalwgt is the statistical weight associated with the respondent. It is a oating-point value that indicates the number of people in the U.S. population this respondent represents. If you read the codebook carefully, you will see that many of the variables arerecodes , which means that they are not part of the raw data collected by the survey; they are calculated using the raw data. For example, prglngth for live births is equal to the raw variable wksgest (weeks of gestation) if it is available; otherwise it is estimated using mosgest (months of gestation times the average number of weeks in a month). Recodes are often based on logic that checks the consistency and accuracy of the data. In general it is a good idea to use recodes when they are available, unless there is a compelling reason to process the raw data yourself. Transformation When you import data like this, you often have to check for errors, deal with special values, convert data into di erent formats, and perform calculations. These operations are called data cleaning . . Transformation nsfg.py includes Clean Fem Preg , a function that cleans the variables I am planning to use. def Clean Fem Preg(df): df.agepreg na vals , , df birthwgt lb
