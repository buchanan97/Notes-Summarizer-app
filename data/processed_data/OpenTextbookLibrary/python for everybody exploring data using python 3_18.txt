Now at this point in our discussion of compilers and interpreters, you should b e wondering a bit about the Python interpreter itself. What language is it written in? Is it written in a compiled language? When we type python , what exactly is happening? The Python interpreter is written in a high-level language called C . You can lo ok at the actual source code for the Python interpreter by going to www.python.org and working your way to their source code. So Python is a program itself and it is compiled into machine code. When you installed Python on your computer (or the vendor installed it), you copied a machine-code copy of the translated Python program onto your system. In Windows, the executable machine code for Python itself is likely in a le with a name like: C: Python35 python.exe CHAPTER . WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN TO WRITE PROGRAMS? That is more than you really need to know to be a Python programmer, but sometimes it pays to answer those little nagging questions right at the begi nning. Writing a program Typing commands into the Python interpreter is a great way to experiment with Python s features, but it is not recommended for solving more complex problems. When we want to write a program, we use
