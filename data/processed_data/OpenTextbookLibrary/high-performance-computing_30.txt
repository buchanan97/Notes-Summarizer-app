not necessary to explicitly tune programs to make good use of the TLB. Once a program is tuned to be cache-friendly , it nearly always is tuned to be TLB friendly . Because there is a performance benefit to keeping the TLB very small, the TLB entry often contains a length field. A single TLB entry can be over a megabyte in length and can be used to translate addresses stored in multiple virtual memory pages. Page Faults A page table entry also contains other information about the page it represents, including flags to tell whether the translation is valid, whether the associated page can be modified, and some information describing how new pages should be initialized. References to pages that aren t marked valid are called page faults . Taking a worst-case scenario, say that your program asks for a variable from a particular memory location. The processor goes to look for it in the cache and finds it isn t there (cache miss), which means it must be loaded from memory . Next it goes to the TLB to find the physical location of the data in memory and finds there is no TLB entry (a TLB miss). Then it tries consulting the page table (and refilling the TLB), but finds that either there is no entry for your particular page or that the memory page has been shipped to disk (both are page faults). Each step of the memory hierarchy has shrugged of f your request. A new page will have to be created in memory and possibly , depending on the circumstances, refilled from disk. Although they take a lot of time, page faults aren t
