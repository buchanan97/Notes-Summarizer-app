total time spent during all calls to resize ()is O(m). Array-Based Lists Proof. We will show that any time resize () is called, the number of calls toaddorremove since the last call to resize () is at least n . Therefore, ifnidenotes the value of nduring theith call to resize () andrdenotes the number of calls to resize (), then the total number of calls to add(i;x) orremove (i) is at least r X i (ni ) m ; which is equivalent to r X i 1ni 2m 2r : On the other hand, the total time spent during all calls to resize () is r X i O(ni) O(m r) O(m); sinceris not more than m. All that remains is to show that the number of calls to add(i;x) orremove (i) between the ( i )th and the ith call to resize () is at least ni . There are two cases to c
