embedded system, such as the computer controlling a washing machine, might in some cases run an operating system, but not provide a le system or other long-term storage. . WHAT IS AN OPERATING SYSTEM? The operating system can provide support for controlled interaction of computations spread among di erent computer systems by using networking. This is another standard feature of general-purpose operating systems. These services are illustrated in Figure . If you have programmed only general-purpose computers, such as PCs, workstations, and servers, you have probably never encountered a computer system that was not running an operating system or that did not allow multiple computations to be ongoing. For example, when you boot up your own computer, chances are it runs Linux, Microsoft Windows, or Mac OS X and that you can run multiple application programs in individual windows on the display screen. These three operating systems will serve as my primary examples throughout the book. To illustrate that a computer can run a single program without an operating system, consider embedded systems. A typical embedded system might have neither keyboard nor display screen. Instead, it might have temperature and pressure sensors and an output that controls the fuel injectors of your car. Alternatively, it might have a primitive keyboard and display, as on a microwave oven, but still be dedicated to running a single program. Some of the most sophisticated embedded systems run multiple cooperating programs and use operating systems. However, more mundane embedded systems take a simpler form. A single program is directly executed by the embedded processor. That program contains instructions to read from input sensors, carry out appropriate computations, and write to the output devices.
