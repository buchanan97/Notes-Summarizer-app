or list and possibly adding or removing an element. This kind of implementation is easy, but not very e cient. Does this really matter? Computers are becoming faster and faster. Maybe the obvious implementation is good enough. Let s do some rough calculations to nd out. Number of operations: Imagine an application with a moderately-sized data set, say of one million ( ), items. It is reasonable, in most applications, to assume that the application will want to look up each item at least once. This means we can expect to do at least one million ( ) searches in this data. If each of these 106searches inspects each of the 106items, this gives a total of 1012(one thousand billion) inspections. Processor speeds: At the time of writing, even a very fast desktop computer can not do more than one billion ( ) operations per second. This Computer speeds are at most a few gigahertz (billions of cycles per second), and each operation typically takes a few cycles. The Need for E ciency means that this application will take at least 1012 1000 seconds, or roughly minutes and seconds. Sixteen minutes is an eon in computer time, but a person might be willing to put up with it (if he or she were headed out for a co ee break). Bigger data sets: Now consider a company like Google, that indexes over billion web pages. By our calculations, doing any kind of query over this data would take at least seconds. We already know that this isn t the case; web searches complete in much less than seconds, and they do much more complicated queries than just asking if a
