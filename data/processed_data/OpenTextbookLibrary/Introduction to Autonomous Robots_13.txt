amount of sensor data? How can we localize in the world? How can error be represented and how can we reason in the face of uncertainty? In order to answer these questions, we will rely on trigonometry, calculus, linear algebra, probability, and algorithms. Specific concepts that will be used throughout this book are basic trigonometry, derivatives and integrals, matrix notation, Bayes formula, and the concept of probability distributions. Robotics is a great vehicle to add meaning to these concepts! . Autonomous manipulation: some core challenges Think about the last time you worked with your hands. This includes typing on your keyboard, writing on a piece of paper, sewing a button onto a shirt, and using a hammer or a screwdriver. You will notice that these activities . Autonomous manipulation: some core challenges require a wide range of dexterity (i.e. the ability to manipulate objects with precision), a wide range of forces, and a wide range of sensorial capabilities. You will also notice that some tasks go beyond your natural capabilities, such as putting yarn through a hole in fabric, turning a screw, or driving a nail into a piece of wood, but can be easily solved with the right tool. Present-day robotic hands are far from reaching the dexterity of a human hand. Yet, with the right tool (called end-effector in robotics speech) some tasks can be solved even faster and more precisely than human capability. Just as with solving a mobile robotics problem, manipulation problems require you to think about the right mix of reasoning and mechanism design. For example, grasping tiny parts might be impossible with tweezers, but quite easy when employing a sucking mechanism. Or, picking up
