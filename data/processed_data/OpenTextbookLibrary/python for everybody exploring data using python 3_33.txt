But what s wrong with class ? It turns out that class is one of Python s keywords . The interpreter uses keywords to recognize the structure of the program, and they cannot be used as variable names. Python reserves keywords: False await else import pass None break except in raise True class finally is return and continue for lambda try as def from nonlocal while assert del global not with async elif if or yield You might want to keep this list handy. If the interpreter complains about one of your variable names and you don t know why, see if it is on this list. Statements Astatement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. We have seen two kinds of statements: print being an expression statement and assignmen t. When you type a statement in interactive mode, the interpreter executes it and displays the result, if there is one. CHAPTER . VARIABLES, EXPRESSIONS, AND STATEMENTS A script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute. For example, the script print( ) x print(x) produces the output The assignment statement produces no output. Operators and operands Operators are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication. The values the operator is applied to are called operands . The operators ,-, , , and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, as in the following examples: hour- hour minute minute ( ) ( - ) There has been a change in the division operator between Python and Python . In Python , the result of this division is a
