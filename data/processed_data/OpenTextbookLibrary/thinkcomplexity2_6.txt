Hub Git Hub provides a view of the notebooks you can can use to read the notebooks and see the results I generated, but you won't be able to modify or run the code. Good luck, and have fun! Allen B. Downey Professor of Computer Science Olin College of Engineering Needham, MA Contributor List If you have a suggestion or correction, please send email to downey allendowney.com . If I make a change based on your feedback, I will add you to the contributor list (unless you ask to be omitted). Let me know what version of the book you are working with, and what format. If you include at least part of the sentence the error appears in, that makes it easy for me to search. Page and section numbers are ne, too, but not quite as easy to work with. Thanks! xvi Chapter Preface John Harley, Je Stanton, Colden Rouleau and Keerthik Omanakuttan are Computational Modeling students who pointed out typos. Jose Oscar Mur-Miranda found several typos. Phillip Loh, Corey Dolphin, Noam Rubin and Julian Ceipek found typos and made helpful suggestions. Sebastian Sch oner sent two pages of corrections! Philipp Marek sent a number of corrections. Jason Woodard co-taught Complexity Science with me at Olin College, introduced me to NK models, and made many helpful suggestions and corrections. Davi Post sent several corrections and suggestions. Graham Taylor sent a pull request on Git Hub that xed many typos. I would especially like to thank the technical reviewers, Vincent Knight and Eric Ma, who made many helpful suggestions, and the copy editor, Charles Roumeliotis, who caught many errors and inconsistencies.
