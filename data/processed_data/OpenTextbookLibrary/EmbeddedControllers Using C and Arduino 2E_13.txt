be created on a whim, so to speak, as they are in Python. A declaration consists of the variable type followed by the variable name, and optionally, an initial value. Multiple declarations are allowed. Here are some examples: char x; declares a signed bit integer called x unsigned char y; declares an unsigned bit integer called y short z, a; declares two signed bit integers named z and a float b ; declares a real number named b and sets its initial value to Note that each of these declarations is followed with a semi-colon. The semi-colon is the C language way of saying This statement ends here . This means that you can be a little sloppy (or unique) in your way of dealing with spaces. The following are all equivalent and legal: float b ; float b ; float b ; Embedded Controllers Functions Functions use the same naming rules as variables. All functions use the same template that looks something like this: return value function name( function argument list ) statement(s) Figure , basic function template You might think of the function in the mathematical sense. That is, you give it some value(s) and it gives you back a value. For example, your calculator has a sine function. You send it an angle and it gives you back a value. In C, functions may have several arguments, not just one. They might not even have an argument. Also, C functions may return a value, but they don t have to. The guts of the function are defined within the opening and closing brace pair . So, a function which takes two integers, x and y, as arguments,
