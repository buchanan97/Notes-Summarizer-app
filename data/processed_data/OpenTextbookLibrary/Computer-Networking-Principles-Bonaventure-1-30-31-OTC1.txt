Many authors chose to write a textbook because there are no textbooks in their eld or because they are not satis ed with the existing textbooks. This frustration has produced several excellent textbooks in the networking community. At a time when networking textbooks were mainly theoretical, Douglas Comer chose to write a textbook entirely focused on the TCP IP protocol suite Comer1988 , a dif cult choice at that time. He later extended his textbook by describing a complete TCP IP implementation, adding practical considerations to the theoretical descriptions in Comer1988 . Richard Stevens approached the Internet
