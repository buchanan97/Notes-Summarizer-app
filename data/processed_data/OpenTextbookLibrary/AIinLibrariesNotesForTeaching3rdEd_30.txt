dead time invested in the hope of higher rewards later. She will also have to pay attention to other pickers, and to the simple nature of the individual trees. If she works in the orchard for several days, she should be able to learn of a reasonable strategy by trial-and-error i.e. by trying a few approaches and favoring those yielding higher total rewards. The whole process amounts to reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning can be used when the ML system has to make a sequence of tasks, or moves, or steps towards some desired goal and there are rewards or penalties for successes or failures. While learning, the system will typically be allowed to try the overall task of reaching the goal many times. Games are a good setting for this e.g. Tic-Tac-Toe or Checkers or Chess. There will be an environment, and possibly permitted moves governed by rules. The system will be rewarded or penalized according to whether a particular move is judged to be good and also, perhaps, whether the system wins or loses the game overall. The system is not programmed with any strategy or tactics, rather it explores the game by trial and error. Another example of reinforcement learning would be a robot exploring an environment e.g. finding a route through a maze. Reinforcement learning is not supervised learning there is no labeled data. It also is not unsupervised learning or self-supervised learning. It is a sui generis ML technique one that needs to have some reward structure. It certainly can be used in language settings. For example, an ML program might be configured to produce five different translations of the same text; then if these could
