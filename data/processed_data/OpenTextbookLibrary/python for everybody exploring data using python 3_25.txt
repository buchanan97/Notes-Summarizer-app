directions perfectly, I have them written down, it says turn left and go one mile at the gas station. Then you say, I am very sorry, because CHAPTER . WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN TO WRITE PROGRAMS? while my instructions were syntactically correct, they sadly contained a small but undetected semantic error. . Again in all three types of errors, Python is merely trying its hardest to do exactly what you have asked. Debugging When Python spits out an error or even when it gives you a result that is di erent from what you had intended, then begins the hunt for the cause of the error. Debugging is the process of nding the cause of the error in your code. When you are debugging a program, and especially if you are working on a hard bug, there are four things to try: reading Examine your code, read it back to yourself, and check that it says what you meant to say. running Experiment by making changes and running di erent versions. Often if you display the right thing at the right place in the program, the problem becomes obvious, but sometimes you have to spend some time to build sca olding. ruminating Take some time to think! What kind of error is it: syntax, runtime, semantic? What information can you get from the error messages, or from the output of the program? What kind of error could cause the problem you re seeing? What did you change last, before the problem appeared? retreating At some point, the best thing to do is back o , undoing recent changes, until you get back to a program that works and that you
