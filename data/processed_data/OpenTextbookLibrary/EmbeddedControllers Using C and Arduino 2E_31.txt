is equal to (2 ). . Write the code to determine the number of bytes required for a variable called POWER SUPPLY. . Assume the bit variable X exists. Write the code to set the MSB (most significant bit), leaving all other bits unchanged. . Assume the bit variable Y exists. Write the code to set the LSB (least significant bit), leaving all other bits unchanged. . Assume the bit variable Z exists. Write the code to clear the MSB and LSB, leaving all other bits unchanged. . Assume the bit variable W exists. Write the code to complement each bit (flip to and to ). .

C Storage Types and Scope Types C has several ways of storing or referencing variables. These affect the way variables behave. Some of the more common ones are: auto, register, and static. Auto variables are variables declared within functions that are not static or register types. That is, the auto keyword is the default. Normally, auto variables are created on the application s stack, although C doesn t require this. The stack is basically a chunk of memory that is allocated for the application s use when it is first run. It is a place for temporary storage, with values popped onto and pulled off of the stack in first-in, last-out order (like a stack of
