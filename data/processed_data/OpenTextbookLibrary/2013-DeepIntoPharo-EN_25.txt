They represent lesystem paths in a very abstract sense, and provide a high-level protocol for working with paths without having to manipulate strings. Here are some examples showing how to de ne absolute paths ( ), relative paths ( ), le extension ( ,), parent navigation ( parent ). Normally you do not need to use Path but here are some examples. fs grif e nurp fs : File System memory. grif e : fs reference To: (Path 'plonk' 'grif e'). nurp : fs reference To: (Path 'nurp'). grif e is File. false grif e is Directory. false grif e parent ensure Create Directory. grif e ensure Create File. grif e exists grif e is File. true grif e copy To: nurp. nurp exists. true grif e delete "absolute path" Path 'plonk' 'feep' plonk feep "relative path" Path 'plonk' 'feep' plonk feep "relative path with extension" Path 'grif e' , 'txt' grif e.txt "changing the extension" Path 'grif e.txt' , 'jpeg' grif e.jpeg "parent directory" (Path 'plonk' 'grif e') parent plonk "resolving a relative path" (Path 'plonk' 'grif e') resolve: (Path '..'
