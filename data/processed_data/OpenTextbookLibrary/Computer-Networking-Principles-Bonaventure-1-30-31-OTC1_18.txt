two users through a service provider. Several connections may exist at the same time between any pair of users. Once established, the connection is used to transfer SDUs. Connections usually provide one bidirectional stream supporting the exchange of SDUs between the two users that are associated through the connection. This stream is used to transfer data during the second phase of the connection called the data transfer phase. The third phase is the termination of the connection. Once the users have nished exchanging SDUs, they request to the service provider to terminate the connection. As we will see later, there are also some cases where the service provider may need to terminate a connection itself. The establishment of a connection can be modelled by using four primitives : Connect.request, Connect.indication, Connect.response and Connect.con rm. The Connect.request primitive is used to request the establishment of a connection. The main parameter of this primitive is the address of the destination user. The service provider delivers a Connect.indication primitive to inform the destination user of the connection attempt. If it accepts to establish a connection, it responds with a Connect.response primitive. At this point, the connection is considered to be open and the destination user can start sending SDUs over the connection. The service provider processes the Connect.response and will deliver a Connect.con rm to the user who initiated the connection. The delivery of this primitive terminates the connection establishment phase. At this point, the connection is considered to be open and both users can send SDUs. A successful connection establishment is illustrated below. The example above shows a successful connection establishment. However, in practice not all connections are successfully established.
