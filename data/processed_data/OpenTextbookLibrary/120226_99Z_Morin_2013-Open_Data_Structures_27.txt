Introduction Discussion and Exercises The List ,USet , and SSet interfaces described in Section are in uenced by the Java Collections Framework . These are essentially simpli ed versions of the List ,Set,Map,Sorted Set , and Sorted Map interfaces found in the Java Collections Framework. The accompanying source code includes wrapper classes for making USet and SSet implementations into Set,Map,Sorted Set , and Sorted Map implementations. For a superb (and free) treatment of the mathematics discussed in this chapter, including asymptotic notation, logarithms, factorials, Stirling s approximation, basic probability, and lots more, see the textbook by Leyman, Leighton, and Meyer . For a gentle calculus text that includes formal de nitions of exponentials and logarithms, see the (freely available) classic text by Thompson . For more information on basic probability, especially as it relates to computer science, see the textbook by Ross . Another good reference, which covers both asymptotic notation and probability, is the textbook by Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik . Readers wanting to brush up on their Java programming can nd many Java tutorials online . Exercise . This exercise is designed to help familiarize the reader with choosing the right data structure for the right problem. If implemented, the parts of this exercise should be done by making use of an implementation of the relevant interface ( Stack ,Queue ,Deque ,USet , or SSet ) provided by the Java Collections Framework. Solve the following problems by reading a text le one line at a time and performing operations on each line in
