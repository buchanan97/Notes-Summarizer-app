dataset, I suggest you explore the variables you are planning to use one at a time, and a good way to start is by Chapter . Distributions ounces020040060080010001200frequencybirthwgt oz Figure : Histogram of the ounce part of birth weight. looking at histograms. In Section we transformed agepreg from centiyears to years, and combinedbirthwgt lb andbirthwgt oz into a single quantity, totalwgt lb . In this section I use these variables to demonstrate some features of histograms. I'll start by reading the data and selecting records for live births: preg nsfg.Read Fem Preg() live preg preg.outcome The expression in brackets is a boolean Series that selects rows from the Data Frame and returns a new Data Frame. Next I generate and plot the histogram of birthwgt lb for live births. hist thinkstats2.Hist(live.birthwgt lb, label birthwgt lb ) thinkplot.Hist(hist) thinkplot.Show(xlabel pounds , ylabel frequency ) When the argument passed to Hist is a pandas Series, any nanvalues are dropped. label is a string that appears in the legend when the Hist is plotted. Figure shows the result. The most common value, called the mode , is pounds. The distribution is approximately bell-shaped, which is the shape .

Chapter . Distributions of the normal distribution, also called a Gaussian distribution. But unlike a true normal distribution, this distribution is asymmetric; it has a tailthat extends farther to the left than to the right. Figure shows the histogram of birthwgt oz , which is the ounces part of birth weight. In theory we expect this distribution to be uniform ; that is,
