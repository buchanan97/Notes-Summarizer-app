undirected graph that represents driving time between cities. nodes in a graph. A path is a sequence of nodes with an edge between each consecutive pair. Graphs are usually drawn with squares or circles for nodes and lines for edges. For example, the directed graph in Figure might represent three people who follow each other on Twitter. The arrow indicates the direction of the relationship. In this example, Alice and Bob follow each other, both follow Chuck, and Chuck follows no one. The undirected graph in Figure shows four cities in the northeast United States; the labels on the edges indicate driving time in hours. In this example the placement of the nodes corresponds roughly to the geography of the cities, but in general the layout of a graph is arbitrary. Network X To represent graphs, we'll use a package called Network X, which is the most commonly used network library in Python. You can read more about it at http: thinkcomplex.com netx , but I'll explain it as we go along. We can create a directed graph by importing Network X (usually imported as nx) and instantiating nx.Di Graph : Chapter Graphs import networkx as nx G nx.Di Graph() At this point, Gis a Di Graph object that contains no nodes and no edges. We can add nodes using the add node method: G.add node( 'Alice ') G.add node( 'Bob ') G.add node( 'Chuck ') Now we can use the nodes method to get a list of nodes: list(G.nodes()) Node View(( 'Alice ', 'Bob ', 'Chuck ')) The nodes method returns a Node View , which can be used in a for loop or, as in this example, used
