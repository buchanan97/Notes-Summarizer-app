p q) (p p). But it can also be used in reverse to factor out a term, as when you start with ( q (p q)) (q (q p)) and factor out the qto getq ((p q) (q p)). CHAPTER . LOGIC AND PROOF So far in this section, I have been working with the laws of Boo lean algebra without saying much about what they mean or why they are reaso nable. Of course, you can apply the laws in calculations without under standing them. But if you want to gure out whichcalculations to do, you need some understanding. Most of the laws are clear enough with a little thought. For ex ample, if we already know that qis false, then p qwill be true when pis true and false whenpis false. That is, p Fhas the same logical value as p. But that s just what the Identity Law for says. A few of the laws need more discussion. The Law of the Excluded Middle, p p T, says that given any proposition p, at least one of por pmust be true. Since pis true exactly when pis false, this is the same as saying that pmust be either true or false. There is no middle ground. The Law of Contradiction, p p F, says that it is not possible for bothpand pto be true. Both of these rules are obvious. The Distributive Laws cannot be called obvious, but a few exa mples can show that they are reasonable. Consider the statement, Thi s card is the ace of spades or clubs. Clearly, this is equivalent to This card i s the ace of spaces or this card
