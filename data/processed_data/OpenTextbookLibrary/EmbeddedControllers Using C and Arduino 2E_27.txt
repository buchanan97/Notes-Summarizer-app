; Let s look at a few examples. Suppose the variables X, Y and Z are unsigned chars. X and Y are set to and , respectively. In hex, that s 0x0d and 0x86 for bit patterns of 00001101 and 10000110. Z X ; Z is 01101000 or 0x68 Z X ; Z is 00000110 or 0x06 Z X; Z is 11110010 or 0xf2 Z X Y; Z is 10001111 or 0x8f Z X Y; Z is 00000100 or 0x04 Z X Y; Z is 10001011 or 0x8b Setting, Clearing and Reading Register Bits Bitwise operations may appear to be somewhat arcane to the uninitiated but are in fact commonly used. A prime use is in setting, clearing and testing specific bits in registers. One example involves configuring bidirectional ports for input or output mode via a data direction register , typically abbreviated DDR. Each bit of the DDR represents a specific output pin. A logic high might indicate output mode while a logic low would indicate input mode. Assuming DDR is an bit register, if you wanted to set all bits except the 0th bit to input mode, you could write5: DDR 0x01; set bit zero to output mode In C, bit position counting, like most sequences, starts from position not position . Embedded Controllers If sometime later you wanted to also set the 1st and 2nd bits to output mode while keeping everything else intact, the easy way to do it is simply to OR the bits you want: DDR DDR 0x06; The prior operation may be performed using the more common shorthand: DDR 0x06; Note that the preceding code does not affect any of the other bits
