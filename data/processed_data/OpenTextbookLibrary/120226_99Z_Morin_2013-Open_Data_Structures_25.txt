we sometimes settle for an amortized or expected running time over a worst-case running time. It is often possible to get a lower expected or amortized running time than a worst-case running time. At the very least, it is very often possible to get a much simpler data structure if one is willing to settle for amortized or expected running times. Introduction Code Samples The code samples in this book are written in the Java programming language. However, to make the book accessible to readers not familiar with all of Java s constructs and keywords, the code samples have been simpli ed. For example, a reader won t nd any of the keywords public , protected ,private , orstatic . A reader also won t nd much discussion about class hierarchies. Which interfaces a particular class implements or which class it extends, if relevant to the discussion, should be clear from the accompanying text. These conventions should make the code samples understandable by anyone with a background in any of the languages from the ALGOL tradition, including B, C, C , C , Objective-C, D, Java, Java Script, and so on. Readers who want the full details of all implementations are encouraged to look at the Java source code that accompanies this book. This book mixes mathematical analyses of running times with Java source code for the algorithms being analyzed. This means that some equations contain variables also found in the source code. These variables are typeset consistently, both within the source code and within equations. The most common such variable is the variable nthat, without exception, always refers to the number of items currently stored in the data structure.
