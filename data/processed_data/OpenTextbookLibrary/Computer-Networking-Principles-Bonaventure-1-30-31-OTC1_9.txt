containing a few devices. We will explain throughout the book the different types of devices and their respective roles enabling all hosts to exchange information. As well as this, we will discuss how networks are interconnected, and the rules that guide these interconnections. We will also analyse how the bus, ring and mesh topologies are used to build real networks. The last point of terminology we need to discuss is the transmission modes. When exchanging information through a network, we often distinguish between three transmission modes. In TV and radio transmission, broadcast is often used to indicate a technology that sends a video or radio signal to all receivers in a given geographical area. Broadcast is sometimes used in computer networks, but only in local area networks where the number of recipients is limited. The rst and most widespread transmission mode is called unicast . In the unicast transmission mode, information is sent by one sender to one receiver. Most of today s Internet applications rely on the unicast transmission mode. The example below shows a network with two types of devices : hosts (drawn as computers) and intermediate nodes (drawn as cubes). Hosts exchange information via the intermediate nodes. In the example below, when host Suses unicast to send information, it sends it via three intermediate nodes. Each of these nodes receives the information from its upstream node or host, then processes and forwards it to its downstream node or host. This is called store and forward and we will see later that this concept is key in computer networks. A second transmission mode is multicast transmission mode. This mode is used when the same information must be sent
