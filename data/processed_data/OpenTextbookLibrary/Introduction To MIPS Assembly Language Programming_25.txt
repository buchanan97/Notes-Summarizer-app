values, or positive numbers to the corresponding negative values. The 's complement operation negates the existing number, making positive numbers negative and ne gative numbers positive. A 's complement representation (or format) simply represents number, either positive or negative. If you are ever asked if a 's complement number is positive or negative, the only appropriate answer is yes, a 's complement numb er can be positive or negative. The following sections will explain how to do a 's complement operation, and how to use 's complement numbers. Being careful to understand the difference between a 's complement operation and 's complement number will b e a big help to the reader. Chapter . The 's Complement Operation A 's complement operation is simply a way to calculate the negation of a 's complement number. It is important to realize that creating a 's complement operation (or negation) is not as simple as putting a minus sign in front of the number. A 's complement operation requires two steps: - Inverting all of the bits in the number; and - Adding to the number. Consider the number 00101100 . The first step is to reverse all of the bits in the number (which will be achieved with a bit -wise ! operation. Note that the ! operator is a unary operation, it only takes one argument , not two. ! (00101100 ) 11010011 INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING Note that in the equation abo ve the bits in the number have simply been reversed, with 's becoming 's, and 's becoming 's. This is also called a 's complement , though in this text we will never use
