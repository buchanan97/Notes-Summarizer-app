Reducing a task to given primitives: programming motion Learning objectives: primitives for specifying motion expressing an algorithm in informal notations and in high- and low-level programming languages program verification program optimization A robot car, its capabilities, and the task to be performed Some aspects of programming can be learned without a computer, by inventing an artificial programming environment as a purely mental exercise. The example of a vehicle that moves under program control in a fictitious landscape is a microcosmos of programming lore. In this section we introduce important concepts that will reappear later in more elaborate settings. The environment. Consider a two-dimensional square grid, a portion of which is enclosed by a wall made up of horizontal and vertical line segments that run halfway between the grid points ( Exhibit ). A robot car enclosed within the wall moves along this grid under computer control, one step at a time, from grid point to adjacent grid point. Before and after each step, the robot's state is described by a location (grid point) and a direction (north, east, south, or west). Exhibit : The robot's crosshairs show its current location on the grid. The robot is controlled by a program that uses the following commands: left Turn degrees counterclockwise. right Turn degrees clockwise. forward Move one step, to the next grid point in front of you goto Send program control to the label . if touch goto If you are touching a wall to your front, send program control
