how to write statements usingvariables, which store values like numbers and words, andoperators, which are symbols that perform a computation. We also explain three kinds of programming errors and offer additional debugging advice. To run the examples in this chapter, you will need to create a new Java class with amainmethod (see Section ). Throughout the book, we often omit class and method definitions to keep the examples concise. Declaring Variables One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to define and manipulate variables. Avariableis a named location in memory that stores avalue. Values may be numbers, text, images, sounds, and other types of data. To store a value, you first have to declare a variable: String message; This statement is called adeclaration, because it declares that the variable messagehas the type String. Each variable has atypethat determines what kind of values it can store. For example, theinttype can store integers like 1and- , and thechartype can store characters like'A'and'z'. Chapter Variables and Operators Some types begin with a capital letter and some with lowercase. You will learn the significance of this distinction later, but for now you should take care to get it right. There is no such type as Intorstring. To declare an integer variable namedx, you simply type this: int x; Note thatxis an arbitrary name for the variable. In general, you should use names that indicate what the variables mean: String first Name; String last Name; int hour, minute; This example declares two variables with type Stringand two with typeint. The last line shows how to declare multiple variables with the same type:hour andminuteare both integers. Note that each declaration statement
