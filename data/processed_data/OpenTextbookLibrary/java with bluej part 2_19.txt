displays the total snowfall for 2005. This program accesses all elements in a speci c row. Of particular importance to this program is the use of the enhanced forin lines - to access the elements in the row for 2005: for (double s : snowfall year ) total s; Listing : Display a speci c cell in a D array 1import java . util .

EXAMPLES Example Accessing all elements in a column Consider the following program that displays the average snowfall for the month of February. In lines - this program accesses elements in the second column of each row. Listing : Display a speci c cell in a D array 1import java . util . Scanner ; 2import java .io. File ; 3import java .io.
