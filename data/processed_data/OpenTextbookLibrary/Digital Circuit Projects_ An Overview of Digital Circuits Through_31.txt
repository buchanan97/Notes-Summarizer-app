values are placed next to each other. To do this, the Gray Codes that were introduced earlier are used. Note how the values for variables B and C are nu mbered as Gray Codes in the -variable K -map table. A BC A'B'C' A'B'C A'BC A'BC' AB'C' AB'C ABC A'BC' Table - : variable K -map DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS Note that once again this number has resulted in regions in the K -map where the variables differ by digit, as shown below. Note that the region C' wraps around the table. Table - : A A' region of a -variable K -map Table - : B B' region of a - variable K -map Table - : C C' region of a -variable K -map To use the K -map to solve variable functions , once again groupings of 2n are found, which for a -variable K -map are , , , and . The larger the grouping, the fewer the terms, so groupings of are chosen over groupings of , groupings of are chosen over groupings of , and groupings of are chosen over groupings of . The following is an example of how to use a K -map to solve a Boolean expression. Consider a function f(A,B,C) has the following truth table: Input f(A,B,C) A B C AND DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS This expression can be represented as the following sum of products. f(A,B,C) ( , , , , ) The min imum function for this K -map consists of one group of and one group of , and corresponds to the equation f(A,B,C) A B'C' . Note the cell AB'C' is used in both equations ,
