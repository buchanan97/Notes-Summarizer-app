exactly the same problems a robot has. A robot is a mobile . Introduction machine that may reason about its environment with sensors and computation. Current robots are far from possessing the capabilities humans have, therefore it is worth considering what strategies youwould employ to solve a problem if youwere to lack some important perception or computational capabilities. Before we move forward to discuss potential strategies for robots with impeded sensory systems, let s rely on a little bit on what we know from studying algorithms and briefly consider a particular strategy. You will need to explore the maze without entering any branch twice. You can use a technique known as depth-first search to do this, but will need to be able to not only map the environment, but also localize in it, e.g., by recognizing places and dead-reckoning on the map. Once you find the gold, you would need to plan the shortest path back to the exit, which you can then use to go back and forth until all the gold is harvested. . Ratslife: an example of autonomous mobile robotics Ratslife is a miniature robot maze competition developed by Olivier Michel from Cyberbotics S.A., which exemplifies a broad range of topics covered in this book. The Ratslife environment can easily be created from LEGO bricks, cardboard or wood and the game can be played with any two mobile robots, preferably ones with the ability to identify markers in the environment. These include simple differential-wheel educational platforms with onboard cameras or even a smartphone driven robot. Figure shows an example environment that can be constructed from craft materials and illustrates some practical aspects of mobile robots for competitions.
