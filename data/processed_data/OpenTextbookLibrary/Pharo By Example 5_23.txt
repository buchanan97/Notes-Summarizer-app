changes to the object. Debug it opens the debugger on the code. Profile it profiles the code with the Pharo profile tool which shows how much time is spent for each message sent. Code search offers several options provided by System Browser, such as browsing the source code of an expression, searching for senders and implementors, and so on. Aquicktourof Pharo Figure - The System Browsershowingthe factorial methodofclass Integer The System Browser The System Browser , also known as Class Browser , is one of the key tools used for programming. As we shall see, there are several interesting browsers available for Pharo, but this is the basic one you will find in any image. The current implementation of the System Browser is called Nautilus, named after the submarine in Jules Verne s novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. Opening the System Browser on a Given Method This is not the usual way that we open a browser on a method: we use more advanced tools! But for the sake of this exercise, execute the following code snippet: Nautilus open On Method: Integer factorial It will open a system browser on the method factorial . We should get a System Browser like in Figure - . The title bar indicates that we are browsing the class Integer and its method factorial . Figure - shows the different entities displayed by the browser: packages, classes, protocols, methods and method definition. The System Browser Figure - The System Browsershowingthe print String methodofclass Object In Pharo, the default System Browser is Nautilus. However, it is possible to have other System Browsers installed in the Pharo enviroment such as Alt Browser. Each System
