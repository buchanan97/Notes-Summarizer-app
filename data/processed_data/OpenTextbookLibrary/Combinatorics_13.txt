Thus, is a design. This basic idea can be generalised in many ways, and the study of structures like these is the basis of design theory. In this course, we will learn some facts about when designs exist, and how to construct them. After studying design theory in this course, you should be able to solve problems such as: Is it possible for a design to exist with a particular set of parameters? What methods might we use in trying to construct a design? . Coding Theory In many people s minds codes and cryptography are inextricably linked, and they might be hard-pressed to tell you the difference. Nonetheless, the two topics are vastly different, as is the mathematics involved in them. Coding theory is the study of encoding information into different symbols. When someone uses a code in an attempt to make a message that only certain other people can read, this becomes cryptography. Cryptographers study strategies for ensuring that a code is di icult to break for those who don t have some additional information. In coding theory, we ignore the question of who has access to the code and how secret it may be. Instead, one of the primary concerns becomes our ability to detect and correct errors in the code. . What is Combinatorics? Codes are used for many purposes in which the information is not intended
