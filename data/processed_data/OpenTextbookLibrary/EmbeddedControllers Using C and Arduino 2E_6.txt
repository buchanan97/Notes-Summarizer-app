Years ago, virtually all embedded work was done in assembly. As microcontrollers have increased in power and the C compilers have improved, the tables have turned. The downside of assembly now weighs against it. Assembly is processor-specific, unstructured, not standardized, nor particularly easy to read or write. C now offers similar performance characteristics to assembly but with all the advantages of a modern structured language. Embedded Controllers . C Memory Organization Introduction When programming in C, it helps if you know at least a little about the internal workings of simple computer systems. As C tends to be close to the metal , the way in which certain things are performed as well preferred coding techniques will be more apparent. First off, let s narrow the field a bit by declaring that we will only investigate a fairly simple system, the sort of thing one might see in an embedded application. That means a basic processor and solid state memory. We won t worry about disk drives, monitors, and so forth. Specific details concerning controller architecture, memory hardware and internal IO circuitry are covered in later chapters. Guts A basic system consists of a control device called a CPU (central processing unit), microprocessor, or microcontroller. There are subtle distinctions between these but we have little need to go very deep at this point. Microcontrollers tend not to be as powerful as standard microprocessors in terms of processing speed but they usually have an array of input output ports and hardware functions (such as analog-todigital or digital-to-analog converters) on chip that typical microprocessors do not. To keep things simple we shall use the term processor as a generic. Microprocessors normally are
