training set, it is unreasonable to expect the ML program to classify js correctly. Even if js appear, there needs to be enough of them in the various fonts and scripts (cursive or not, monospaced or proportional, etc.) for the program to be able to learn what is correct and what is not. OCR, i.e. recognizing the actual individual characters, would not usually be an end in itself. Rather, the interest would be in the words that those characters form, or, more generally, the text. If the OCR, or Text Recognition, application has access to a wider context of text, that can improve its performance. For example, if the ML is recognizing entire words from their component characters, and separators, then the first letter of the word On is going to be the letter upper case O and not the numeric letter zero the number zero makes no sense in that context. Supervised learning needs labeled data for its training data. Getting such data with quality and in quantity is not easy. Often experts will be required to do the labeling e.g. of medical images, or of the correct cataloging numbers for books in libraries. But many experts would struggle if confronted with , items to label. Sometimes the process can be eased, at a financial cost, by crowdsourcing (Wikipedia 2023c). For example, the La MDA models of dialog agents uses crowdsourcing, where the members of the crowd are supplied with calculators and access to a web browser and a search engine so they can check how reliable the output information is that the dialog agents supply (Thoppilan et al. 2022). Unsupervised The word supervised comes in to qualify learning
