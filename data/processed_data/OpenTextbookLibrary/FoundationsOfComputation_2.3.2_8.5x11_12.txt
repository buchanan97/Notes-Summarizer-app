mathematics, th e word or is always taken in the inclusive sense of p q. Now, any compound proposition that uses any of the operators , , and can be rewritten as a logically equivalent proposition that uses only , , and . It is easy to check that p qis logically equivalent to ( p) q. (Just make a truth table for ( p) q.) Similarly, p qcan be expressed as (( p) q) (( q) p), So, in a strict logical sense, , , and are unnecessary. . PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC (Nevertheless, they are useful and important, and we won t g ive them up.) Even more is true: In a strict logical sense, we could do witho ut the conjunction operator . It s easy to check that p qis logically equivalent to ( p q), so any expression that uses can be rewritten as one that uses only and . Alternatively, we could do without and write everything in terms of and . Certain types of proposition will play a special role in our f urther work with logic. In particular, we de ne tautologies and contradicti ons as follows: De nition . A compound proposition is said to be a tautology if and only if it istruefor all possible combinations of truth values of the proposi tional variables which it contains. A compound proposition is said to be acontradiction if and only if it is falsefor all possible combinations of truth values of the propositional variables which it contains. For example, the proposition (( p q) q) pis a tautology. This can be checked with a truth table: pqp q q(p q) q((p q) q) p
