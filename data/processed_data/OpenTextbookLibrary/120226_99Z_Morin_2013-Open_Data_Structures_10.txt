illustrated in Figure . In a LIFO Queue , the most recently added element is the next one removed. This is best visualized in terms of a stack of plates; plates are placed on the top of the stack and also Introduction 16add(x)remove () delete Min () x6 Figure : A priority Queue . remove () pop ()add (x) push (x) x Figure : A stack. removed from the top of the stack. This structure is so common that it gets its own name: Stack . Often, when discussing a Stack , the names ofadd(x) and remove () are changed to push (x) and pop(); this is to avoid confusing the LIFO and FIFO queueing disciplines. ADeque is a generalization of both the FIFO Queue and LIFO Queue (Stack ). A Deque represents a sequence of elements, with a front and a back. Elements can be added at the front of the sequence or the back of the sequence. The names of the Deque operations are self-explanatory: add First (x),remove First (),add Last (x), and remove Last (). It is worth noting that a Stack can be implemented using only add First (x) and remove First () while a FIFO Queue can be implemented using add Last (x) andremove First (). The List Interface: Linear Sequences This book will talk very little about the FIFO Queue ,Stack , or Deque interfaces. This is because these interfaces are subsumed by the List interface.
