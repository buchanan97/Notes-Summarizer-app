modified as they collide with the ever-refreshed rubber band: We temporarily set 'Pen Mode(pat Xor)'. We encourage you to experiment by modifying this procedure in two ways: .Change the first call of the 'procedure Draw Line(L.p , L.p2, black)' to 'Draw Line(L.p , L.p2, white)'. You will have turned the procedure 'Drag Line' into an artful, if somewhat random, painting brush. .Remove the call 'Pen Mode(pat Xor)' (thus reestablishing the default 'pn Mode pat Copy'), but leave the first 'Draw Line(L.p1, L.p2, white)', followed by the second 'Draw Line(L.p , L.p2, black)'. You now have a naive rubber-band routine: It alternates erasing (draw 'white') and drawing (draw 'black') the current rubber band, but in so doing it modifies other objects that share pixels with the rubber band. This is our first example of the use of the versatile exclusive-or; others will follow later in the book. program Frame; provides mouse input and drawing of points, line segments, circles typepoint record x, y: real end; line Segment record p1, p2: point endpoints end; This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License varc, p: point; r: real; radius of a circle L: line Segment; procedure Wait For Click; begin repeat until Button; while Button do end; procedure Get Point (var p: point); var v, h: integer; begin Get Mouse(v, h); p.x : v; p.y : h convert integer to real end; procedure Draw Point(p: point; pat: Pattern); const t ; radius of a point begin Pen Pat(pat); Paint Oval(round(p.y) t, round(p.x) t, round(p.y) t, round(p.x) t) end; procedure Click Point(var p: point); begin Wait For Click; Get Point(p); Draw Point(p, Black) end; function Dist(p, q: point): real; begin Dist :
