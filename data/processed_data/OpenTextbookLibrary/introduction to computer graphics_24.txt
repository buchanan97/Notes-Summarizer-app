view during an animation can giv e the e ect of moving or ying through the scene. Of course, it can be di cult to compute the necessary changes. There are many techniques to help with the computation. One of the most important is to use a physics engine, which computes the motion and interaction of objec ts based on the laws of physics. (However, you won t learn about physics engines in this book .) CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION Hardware and Software We will be using Open GL as the primary basis for D graphics programming. The origin al versionof Open GLwasreleasedin1992byacompanynamed Sili con Graphics,whichwasknown for its graphics workstations powerful, expensive comput ers designed for intensive graphical applications. (Today, you have more graphics computing pow er on your smart phone.) Open GL is supported by the graphics hardware in most modern computi ng devices, including desktop computers, laptops, and many mobile devices. In the form of W eb GL, it is the used for most D graphics on the Web. This section will give you a bit of back ground about the history of Open GL and about the graphics hardware that supports it. In the rst desktop computers, the contents of the screen wer e managed directly by the CPU. For example, to draw a line segment on the screen, the CPU would run a loop to set the color of each pixel that lies along the line. Needless to say, graphics could take up a lot of the CPU s time. And graphics performance was very slow, compare d to what we expect today. So what has changed? Computers are much faster in general, of co urse, but
