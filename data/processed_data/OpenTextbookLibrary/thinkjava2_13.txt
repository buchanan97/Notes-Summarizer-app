selecting all text (Ctrl A) and pressing the Tabkey. Organizations that do a lot of software development usually have strict guidelines on how to format source code. For example, Google publishes its Java coding standards for use in open source projects:https: google.github. io styleguide javaguide.html. You probably won t understand these guidelines now, because they refer to language features you haven t yet seen. But you might want to refer to them periodically as you read this book. Using Escape Sequences Using Escape Sequences It s possible to display multiple lines of output with only one line of code. You just have to tell Java where to put the line breaks: public class Hello3 public static void main(String args) System.out.print("Hello! n How are you doing? n"); The output is two lines, each ending with a newline character: Hello! How are you doing? Each nis anescape sequence, or two characters of source code that represent a single character. (The backslash allows you toescapethe string to write special characters.) Notice there is no space between nand How. If you add a space there, there will be a space at the beginning of the second line. nnewline t tab "double quote backslash Table : Common escape sequences Java has a total of eight escape sequences, and the four most commonly used ones are listed in Table . For example, to write quotation marks inside of strings, you need to escape them with a backslash: System.out.println("She said "Hello! " to me."); The result is as follows: She said "Hello!" to me. Chapter Computer Programming What Is Computer Science? This book intentionally omits some details about the Java language (such as the other escape sequences),
