Thread A 1mutex.wait() critical section count count 4mutex.signal()Thread B 1mutex.wait() critical section count count 4mutex.signal() Sincemutexis initially , whichever thread gets to the wait rst will be able to proceed immediately. Of course, the act of waiting on the s emaphore has the e ect of decrementing it, so the second thread to arrive will have to wait until the rst signals. I have indented the update operation to show that it is contai ned within the mutex. In this example, both threads are running the same code. This is sometimes called asymmetric solution. If the threads have to run di erent code, the solution isasymmetric . Symmetric solutions are often easier to generalize. In thi s case, the mutex solution can handle any number of concurrent threads without modi cation. As long as every thread waits before performin g an update and signals after, then no two threads will access countconcurrently. Often the code that needs to be protected is called the critical section , I suppose because it is critically important to prevent concu rrent access. In the tradition of computer science and mixed metaphors, th ere are several otherwayspeoplesometimes talkaboutmutexes. Inthemetap hor wehavebeen using so far, the mutex is a token that is passed from one threa d to another. In an alternative metaphor, we think of the critical section as a room, and only one thread is allowed to be in the room at a time. In this me taphor, mutexes are called locks, and a thread is said to lock the mute x before entering and unlock it while exiting. Occasionally, though, people m ix the metaphors and talk about getting or releasing a lock,
