Web Development and Programming Chapter of the data center. In the current traditional model, thin, physically compact servers are stacked vertically. These are referred to as rack mount hardware. Many rack mount systems today contain hardware similar to what we have in our desktops, despite the difference in appearance. A number of companies, including Google, Yahoo, and Facebook, are looking to re - invent this concept. Google for instance has already used custom-built servers in parts of its network in an effort to improve efficiency and reduce costs. One implementation they have tried proved so efficient that they were able to eliminate large power backup units by placing a volt battery in each server giving it enough emergency power to keep running until the building s backup power source could kick in. They have also experimented with alternative cooling methods like using water from retention ponds, or placing datacenters where they can take advantage of natural resources like sea water for cooling or wind and solar for energy. ADDITIONAL NOTES Take note! While all of the programs we refer to in our LAMP stack have free, open source versions, not all uses may be covered by those licenses (using them for study and research purposes is covered). Even small, low powered devices are finding demand as servers in part to enable the Internet of Things . Devices like the Raspberry Pi12 and an explosion of similar products like android sticks can be purchased for as little as USD. These small, just-enoughpower devices are used to connect data from the environment or other devices to the Internet, leaving the data center behind and living instead at the source of the data
