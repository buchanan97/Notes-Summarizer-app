specifying astrvalue, you must usequotation marks(either single or double). For one thing, this is how Python know that you intend to create astras opposed to some other type. Examples: slang 'lit' grade "3rd" donut store "Paul's Bakery" url 'http: umweagles.com' Notice, by the way, that astring of digitsis not the same as an integer. To wit: schwarzenegger weight action movie " " type(schwarzenegger weight) int type(action movie) str See? The quotes make all the difference. CHAPTER . THREE KINDS OF ATOMIC DATA The length of a string We ll do many things with strings in this book. Probably the most basic is simply to inquire as to a string slength, or the number of characters it contains. To do this, we enclose the variable s name in parentheses after the wordlen: len(slang) len(donut store) As we ll see, thelen()operation (and many others like it) is an example of afunctionin Python. In proper lingo, when we write a line of code likelen(donut store)we say we are calling the function, which simply means to invoke or trigger it. More lingo: for obscure reasons, the value inside the bananas (here, donut store) is called anargumentto the function. And we say that we pass one or more arguments to a function when we call it. Allthesetermsmayseempedantic,buttheyarepreciseanduniversallyused, so be sure to learn them. The preceding line of code can be completely summed up by saying: We arecallingthelen()function, andpassingit thedonut storevariableas anargument. I recommend you say that sentence out loud at least four times in a row to get used to its rhythm. . THE THREE KINDS IN PYTHON21 Note, by the way, that thelen()function expects astrargument. You can t calllen()with anintor afloatvariable as an argument:
