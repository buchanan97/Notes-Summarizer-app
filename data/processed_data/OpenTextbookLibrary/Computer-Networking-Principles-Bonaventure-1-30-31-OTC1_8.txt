now often replaced by star-shaped networks. In metropolitan networks, rings are often used to interconnect multiple locations. In this case, two parallel links, composed of different cables, are often used for redundancy. With such a dual ring, when one ring fails all the traf c can be quickly switched to the other ring. A fth physical organisation of a network is the tree. Such networks are typically used when a large number of customers must be connected in a very cost-effective manner. Cable TV networks are often organised as trees. In practice, most real networks combine part of these topologies. For example, a campus network can be organised as a ring between the key buildings, while smaller buildings are attached as a tree or a star to important buildings.

Throughout this book, our objective will be to understand the protocols and mechanisms that are necessary for a network such as the one shown below.
