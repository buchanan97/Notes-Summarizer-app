Type timein the dialog box and click OK(or press Enter). A list of classes is displayed, whose names contain the substring time. Choose one (say, Time), and the browser will show it, along with a class comment that suggests other classes that might be useful. If you want to browse one of the others, select its name (in any text pane), and type CMD-b. Note that if you type the complete (and correctly capitalized) name of a class in the find dialog, the browser will go directly to that class without showing you the list of options. Usingthe Finder You can also open the Finder that is available from the World Tools menu, and type part of the name of the class and change the Selectors to Classes in the right combo box. It is less efficient than using Spotter or the System Browser as explained above. The Finder is more useful for other types of code searches such as find methods based on examples, as we will show later. Aquicktourof Pharo Finding Methods Sometimes you can guess the name of a method, or at least part of the name of a method, more easily than the name of a class. For example, if you are interested in the current time, you might expect that there would be a method called now , or containing now as a substring. But where might it be? Spotter and Findercan help you. Spotter With Spotter you can also find methods. Either by getting a class and
