language might include instructions for ADD, SUBTRACT, DIVIDE, and MULTIPLY, but it wouldn t contain an instruction for AVERAGE. In most cases, a single instruction, called an opcode , carries out a single machine operation on one or more pieces of data, called its operands . Therefore, the process of averaging two numbers would have to be broken down into two or more steps. A machine language instruction itself might have something similar to the following format, in which an opcode is followed by several operands, which refer to the locations in the computer s primary memory where the data are stored. The following instruction says ADD the number in LOCATION1 to the number in LOCATION2 and store the result in LOCATION3: Opcode Operand Operand Operand 011110 110110 111100 111101 (ADD) (LOCATION ) (LOCATION ) (LOCATION ) Given the primitive nature of machine language, an expression like (a b) 2would have to be translated into a sequence of several machine language instructions that, in binary code, might look as follows: 011110110110111100111101 000101000100010001001101 001000010001010101111011 In the early days of computing, before high-level languages were developed, computers had to be programmed directly in their machine languages, an extremely tedious and error-prone process. Imagine how dif cult it would be to detect an error that consisted of putting a in the preceding program where a should occur! Fortunately, we no longer have to worry about machine languages, because special programs can be used to translate a high-level or source code program into machine language code or object code , which is the only code that can be executed or run by the computer. In general, a program that translates source code to object
