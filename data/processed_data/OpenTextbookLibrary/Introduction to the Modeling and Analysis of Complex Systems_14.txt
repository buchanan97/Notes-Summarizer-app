this textbook1: Complex systems are networks made of a number of components that interact with each other, typically in a nonlinear fashion. Complex systems may arise and evolve through self-organization, such that they are neither completely regular nor completely random, permitting the development of emergent behavior at macroscopic scales. These properties can be found in many real-world systems, e.g., gene regulatory networks within a cell, physiological systems of an organism, brains and other neural systems, food webs, the global climate, stock markets, the Internet, social media, national and international economies, and even human cultures and civilizations. To better understand what complex systems are, it might help to know what they are not. One example of systems that are not complex is a collection of independent components, such as an ideal gas (as discussed in thermodynamics) and random coin tosses (as discussed in probability theory). This class of systems was called problems of disorganized complexity by American mathematician and systems scientist Warren Weaver . Conventional statistics works perfectly when handling such independent entities. Another example, which is at the other extreme, is a collection of strongly coupled compo1 In fact, the rst sentence of this de nition is just a bit wordier version of Herbert Simon s famous definition in his 1962 paper : A complex system is a system made up of a large number of parts that interact in a nonsimple way.

Weaver called this class of systems problems of simplicity . In this class, the components of a system are tightly coupled to
