(This operator is usually referred to as nor, short for not or ). Show that each of the propositions p,p q,p q,p q,p q, andp qcan be rewritten as a logically equivalent proposition that uses as its only operator. Boolean Algebra So far we have discussed how to write and interpret propositi ons. This section deals with manipulating them. For this, we need algebra. Ordinary algebra, of the sort taught in high school, is about manipulating number s, variables that represent numbers, and operators such as and that apply to numbers. Now, we need an algebra that applies to logical values, propositi onal variables, and logical operators. The rst person to think of logic in terms of algebra was the mathematician, George Boole, who introduced the idea in a book that he . BOOLEAN ALGEBRA published in 1854. The algebra of logic is now called Boolean algebra in his honor. The algebra of numbers includes a large number of rules for ma nipulating expressions. The distributive law, for example, says that x(y z) xy xz, wherex,y, andzare variables that stand for any numbers or numerical expressions. This law means that whenever you see something of the form xy xzin a numerical expression, you can substitute x(y z) without changing the value of the expression, and vice versa . Note that the equals sign in x(y z) xy xzmeans has the same value as, no matter what numerical values x,y, andzhave. In Boolean algebra, we work with logical values instead of nu merical values. There are only two logical values, true and false. We will wri te these values as Tand F. The symbols Tand Fplay a similar role in Boolean
