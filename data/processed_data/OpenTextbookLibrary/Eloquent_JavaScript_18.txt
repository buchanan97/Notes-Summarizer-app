by enclosing their content in quotes. Down on the sea "Lie on the ocean" 'Float on the ocean' You can use single quotes, double quotes, or backticks to mark strings, as long as the quotes at the start and the end of the string match. You can put almost anything between quotes to have Java Script make a string value out of it. But a few characters are more di icult. You can imagine how putting quotes between quotes might be hard, since they will look like the end of the string. Newlines (the characters you get when you press enter) can be included only when the string is quoted with backticks ( ). To make it possible to include such characters in a string, the following notation is used: a backslash ( ) inside quoted text indicates that the character after it has a special meaning. This is called escaping the character. A quote that is preceded by a backslash will not end the string but be part of it. When anncharacter occurs after a backslash, it is interpreted as a newline. Similarly, atafter a backslash means a tab character. Take the following string: "This is the first line n And this is the second" This is the actual text in that string: This is the first line And this is the second Thereare, ofcourse, situationswhereyouwantabackslashinastringtobejust a backslash, not a special code. If two backslashes follow each other, they will collapse together, and only one will be left in the resulting string value. This is how the string A newline character is written like " n". can be expressed: "A newline character is written like " n "." Strings,
