particular page is in their list of indexed pages. At the time of writing, Google receives approximately ; queries per second, meaning that they would require at least ; : ; very fast servers just to keep up. The solution: These examples tell us that the obvious implementations of data structures do not scale well when the number of items, n, in the data structure and the number of operations, m, performed on the data structure are both large. In these cases, the time (measured in, say, machine instructions) is roughly n m. The solution, of course, is to carefully organize data within the data structure so that not every operation requires every data item to be inspected. Although it sounds impossible at rst, we will see data structures where a search requires looking at only two items on average, independent of the number of items stored in the data structure. In our billion instruction per second computer it takes only :000000002 seconds to search in a data structure containing a billion items (or a trillion, or a quadrillion, or even a quintillion items). We will also see implementations of data structures that keep the items in sorted order, where the number of items inspected during an operation grows very slowly as a function of the number of items in the data structure. For example, we can maintain a sorted set of one billion items while inspecting at most items during any operation. In our billion instruction per second computer, these operations take :00000006 seconds each. The remainder of this chapter brie y reviews some of the main concepts used throughout the rest of the book. Section describes the in3
