in assembly . By showing how pr ogram constructs fr om these HLL map int o assembly , the concepts will be easier t o understand and use when the pr ogrammer implements pr ograms in languages like Ja va or C C . Concepts such as r eferences and v ariables, r egisters, binar y and Boolean oper ations, subpr ogram ex ecution, memor y types (heap, stack, and static), and arr ay processing ar e co vered to clarify the decisions made when implementing HLL. Pr ogram contr ol is pr esented using a mapping fr om structur ed pr ograms in pseudo code t o help students understand structur ed pr ogramming, and why it exists. Memor y access in assembly is pr esented t o high light the diff erence between r eferences (pointers) and v alues, and how these impact HLL. This book has numer ous code examples, and many pr oblems at the end of each chapter , and it is appr opriate for a class in Assembly Language, or as a extr a resour ce for a class in Computer Organization.
