That de nition is pretty abstract, so let's start with a concrete example: sound. Sound is variation in air pressure. A sound signal represents variations in air pressure over time. A microphone is a device that measures these variations and generates an electrical signal that represents sound. A speaker is a device that takes an electrical signal and
