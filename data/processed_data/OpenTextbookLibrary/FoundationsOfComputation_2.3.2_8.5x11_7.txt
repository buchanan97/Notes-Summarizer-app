the component propositions p,q, andrhave. We say that is anassociative operation. We ll see more about associativity and other properties of operations in the next section. Suppose we want to verify that, in fact, ( p q) randp (q r) do always have the same value. To do so, we have to consider all possible combinations of valuesof p,q, andr, andcheckthatforallsuchcombinations, thetwocompound expressions do indeed have the same value. It is convenient t o organize this computation into a truth table. A truth table is a table that shows the value of one or more compound propositions for each possible combi nation of values of the propositional variables that they contain. Figure .1is a truth table that compares the value of ( p q) rto the value of p (q r) for all possible values ofp,q, andr. There are eight rows in the table because there are exactly e ight di erent ways in which truth values can be assigned to p,q, andr. In this table, we see that the last two columns, representing the val ues of (p q) r andp (q r), are identical. Moregenerally, wesaythattwocompoundpropositionsare logically equivalentif they always have the same value, no matter what truth value s are assigned to the propositional variables that they contain. If the number of propositional variables is small, it is easy to use a truth ta ble to check whether or not two propositions are logically equivalent. In general, if there are nvariables, then there are 2ndi erent ways to assign truth values to the variables. This might become clear to you if you try to come up wi th a scheme for systematically listing all possible sets of
