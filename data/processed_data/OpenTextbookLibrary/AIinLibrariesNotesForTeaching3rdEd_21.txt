data is the encoding of observational or experiential reports about the world. At one point, historically, such data would have been assumed to be a solid bedrock. Nowadays, most philosophers of science would describe observation reports, or data of this kind, as being 'theory-laden'. Really, they are two aspects to this assertion. Any observation report relies on theories which infuse either the instruments used or the raw observations (if there is any such thing as truly raw observations) (Duhem 1914; Hanson 1958). Duhem writes: Go into this laboratory; draw near this table crowded with so much apparatus: an electric battery, copper wires wrapped in silk, vessels filled with mercury, coils, a small iron bar carrying a mirror. An observer plunges the metallic stem of a rod, mounted with rubber, into small holes; the iron oscillates and, by means of the mirror tied to it, sends a beam of light over to a celluloid ruler, and the observer follows the movement of the light beam on it. There, no doubt, you have an experiment; by means of the vibration of this spot of light, the physicist minutely observes the oscillations of the piece of iron. Ask him now what he is doing. Is he going to answer I am studying the oscillations of the piece of iron carrying this mirror? No, he will tell you that he is measuring the electrical resistance of a coil. If you are astonished and ask him what meaning these words have, and what relation they have to the phenomena he has perceived and which you have at the same time perceived, he will reply that your question would require some very long explanations, and he
