can use to keep track of code you write while working on this book. Then you can clone the repo, which means that you make a copy of the les on your computer. Or you could clone my repository. You don't need a Git Hub account to do this, but you won't be able to write your changes back to Git Hub. If you don't want to use Git at all, you can download the les in a Zip le using the button in the lower-right corner of the Git Hub page. All of the code is written to work in both Python and Python with no translation. I developed this book using Anaconda from Continuum Analytics, which is a free Python distribution that includes all the packages you'll need to run the . Using the code ix code (and lots more). I found Anaconda easy to install. By default it does a user-level installation, not system-level, so you don't need administrative privileges. And it supports both Python and Python . You can download Anaconda from http: continuum.io downloads . If you don't want to use Anaconda, you will need the following packages: pandas for representing and analyzing data, http: pandas.pydata. org ; Num Py for basic numerical computation, http: www.numpy.org ; Sci Py for scienti c computation including statistics, http: www. scipy.org ; Stats Models for regression and other statistical analysis, http: statsmodels.sourceforge.net ; and matplotlib for visualization, http: matplotlib.org . Although these are commonly used packages, they are not included with all Python installations, and they can be hard to install in some environments. If you have trouble installing them, I strongly recommend using Anaconda or one of
