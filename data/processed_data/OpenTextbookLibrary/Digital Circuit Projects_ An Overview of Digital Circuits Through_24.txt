hy these three, and only these three, operations are chosen. The answer is that these three operations are universal Boolean operations . In this context, universal means that any Boolean function can be reduced to com binations of these three operations. Therefore, there is never a need to define any other Boolean operations to calculate a Boolean function. Other useful Boolean operations will be introduced in this textbook, but realize that these operations can be reduced to simply AND, OR, and NOT operations . The proof of this will be left to the exercises at the end of this chapter. This result, and AND, OR, and NOT are Universal over Boolean functions is even more amazing when it is realized that any effectively computable function is computable using only Boolean functions. This result, t hat any effectively computable function is computable with just the operations AND, OR, and NOT, was personally mind blowing when I first understood it. DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS In this textbook, the AND operation will be written using the multiplication sign, " ", and the result call a product; the OR operation will be written using the " " sign, and will be called a sum; the NOT operation will be shown by following the variable with a single "'" mark, e.g. A' is NOT -A. Not e also that the " " symbol can be dropped as in standard algebra, so "A B" can also be written simply as "AB". Truth Tables Boolean functions are functions that perform operations on sets of Boolean variables. For example, a Boolean function f, which takes input va lues A and B, would produce an output value, f(A,B). The
