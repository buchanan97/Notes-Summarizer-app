Open GL ES. GLSL uses a syntax similar to the C programming language. As a nal remark on GPU hardware, I should note that the comput ations that are done for di erent vertices are pretty much independent, and so can po tentially be done in parallel. The same is true of the computations for di erent fragments. In f act, GPUs can have hundreds or thousands of processors that can operate in parallel. Admit tedly, the individual processors are much less powerful than a CPU, but then typical per-vertex an d per-fragment computations are not very complicated. The large number of processors, an d the large amount of parallelism that is possible in graphics computations, makes for impres sive graphics performance even on fairly inexpensive GPUs. Chapter Two-Dimensional Graphics With this chapter, we begin our study of computer graphics by looking at the twodimensional case. Things are simpler and a lot easier to visu alize in D than in D, but most of the ideas that are covered in this chapter will also be very relevant to D. The chapter begins with four sections that examine D graphi cs in a general way, without tying it to a particular programming language or graphics AP I. The coding examples in these sections are written in pseudocode that should make sense to anyone with enough programming background to be reading this book. In the next three section s, we will take quick looks at D graphics in three particular languages: Java with Graphics2 D , Java Script with HTML canvas graphics, and SVG. We will see how these languages use many of the general ideas from earlier in the chapter. Pixels,
