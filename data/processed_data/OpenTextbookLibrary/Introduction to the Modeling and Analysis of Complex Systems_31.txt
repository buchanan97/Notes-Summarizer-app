it. We don t have a good mental template to use to capture the essence of this pattern2. I hope that these examples have made my point clear by now. Coming up with a model is inherently a personal process, which depends on your own knowledge, experience, and worldview. There is no single algorithm or procedure you can follow to develop a good model. The modeling process is a full-scale interaction between the external world and your whole, intellectual self. To become a good modeler, you will need to gain diverse knowledge and experience and develop rich worldviews. This is why I said it would be very dif cult to be taught. Exercise Create a few different models for each of the examples shown above. Discuss how those models differ from each other, and what you should do to determine which model is more appropriate as an explanation of the observed behavior. For those who are curious this kind of curve could be generated by raising a sine or cosine function of time to an odd number (e.g., sin3(t),cos5(t)), but I am not sure if knowing this would ever help you in your future career. . MODELING COMPLEX SYSTEMS Modeling Complex Systems The challenge in developing a model becomes particularly tough when it comes to the modeling of complex systems, because their unique properties (networks, nonlinearity, emergence, self-organization, etc.) are not what we are familiar with. We usually think about things on a single scale in a step-by-step, linear chain of reasoning, in which causes and effects are clearly distinguished and discussed sequentially. But this approach is not suitable for understanding complex systems where a massive amount of components are
