is partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe spatial changes of functions in addition to their temporal changes. We will discuss these modeling frameworks later in this textbook. Evolution andadaptation have been discussed in several different contexts. One context is obviously evolutionary biology, which can be traced back to Charles Darwin s evolutionary theory. But another, which is often discussed more closely to complex systems, is developed in the complex adaptive systems context, which involves evolutionary computation ,arti cial neural networks , and other frameworks of man-made adaptive systems that are inspired by biological and neurological processes. Called soft computing ,machine learning , orcomputational intelligence , nowadays, these frameworks began their rapid development in the 1980s, at the same time when complex systems science was about to arise, and thus they were strongly coupled conceptually as well as in the literature. In complex systems science, evolution and adaptation are often considered to be general mechanisms that can not only explain biological processes, but also create non-biological processes that have dynamic learning and creative abilities. This goes well beyond what a typical biological study covers. Finally, networks andcollective behavior are probably the most current research fronts of complex systems science (as of 2015). Each has a relatively long history of its own. In particular, the study of networks was long known as graph theory in mathematics, which was started by Leonhard Euler back in the 18th century. In the meantime, the recent boom of network and collective behavior research has been largely driven by the availability of increasingly large amounts of data. This is obviously caused by the explosion of the Internet and the WWW, and especially the rise of mobile phones
