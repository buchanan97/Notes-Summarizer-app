eloped, raster displays were too slow and expensive to be practical. Fortunately, it was poss ible to use vacuum tube technology in another way: The electron beam could be made to directly dr aw a line on the screen, simply by sweeping the beam along that line. A vector graphics displ ay would store a display list of lines that should appear on the screen. Since a point on the screen would glow only very brie y after being illuminated by the electron beam, the gra phics display would go through the display list over and over, continually redrawing all the li nes on the list. To change the image, it would only be necessary to change the contents of the displ ay list. Of course, if the display list became too long, the image would start to icker because a line would have a chance to visibly fade before its next turn to be redrawn. But here is the point: For an image that can be speci ed as a rea sonably small number of geometric shapes, the amount of information needed to repre sent the image is much smaller using a vector representation than using a raster represent ation. Consider an image made up of one thousand line segments. For a vector representation o f the image, you only need to store the coordinates of two thousand points, the endpoints of the lines. This would take up only a few kilobytes of memory. To store the image in a frame bu er fo r a raster display would require much more memory. Similarly, a vector display could draw the lines on the screen more quickly than a raster
