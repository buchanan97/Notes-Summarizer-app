GPU to draw a g iven image. Open GL draws primitives such as triangles. Specifying a pri mitive means specifying coordinates and attributes for each of its vertices. In the o riginal Open GL , a separate command was used to specify the coordinates of each vertex, a nd a command was needed each time the value of an attribute changed. To draw a single trian gle would require three or more commands. Drawing a complex object made up of thousands of tr iangles would take many thousands of commands. Even in Open GL , it became possibl e to draw such an object with a single command instead of thousands. All the data for the ob ject would be loaded into arrays, which could then be sent in a single step to the GPU. Unfortuna tely, if the object was going to be drawn more than once, then the data would have to be retrans mitted each time the object was drawn. This was xed in Open GL with Vertex Bu er Objects . A VBO is a block of memory in the GPU that can store the coordinates or attribu te values for a set of vertices. This makes it possible to reuse the data without having to ret ransmit it from the CPU to the GPU every time it is used. Similarly, Open GL introduced texture objects to make it possible to store several images on the GPU for use as textures. This means that texture images that are going to be reused several times can be loaded once into the GPU, so tha t the GPU can easily switch between images without having to reload them.
