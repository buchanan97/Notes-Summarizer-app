analysis, and different analyses might begin with different rules. In Example , we could have begun by noticing that no matter what else she may choose, Grace has four possible options for her beverage. Thus, the total number of possible breakfast orders will be four times the number of possible orders of main and side (with optional extras). Then we could have proceeded to analyse the number of possible choices for her main dish and her side dish (together with the extras). Breaking down the choices for her main and side dishes into the same cases as before, we could see that there are choices in the first case; choices in the second case; choices in the third case; and choices in the fourth case. Thus she has a total of choices for her main and side dishes. The product rule now tells us that she has possible orders for her breakfast. Let s run through one more (simpler) example of using both the sum and product rules, and work out the answer in two different ways. EXAMPLE . Ming plans to buy her Dad a shirt for his birthday. The store she goes to has three different colours of short-sleeved shirts, and six different colours of long-sleeved shirts. They will gift-wrap in her choice of two wrapping papers. Assuming that she wants the shirt gift-wrapped, how many different options does she have for her gift? SOLUTION. Let s start by applying the product rule first. There are two aspects that Ming can vary: the shirt, and the wrapping. She has two choices for the wrapping, so her total number of options will be twice the number of shirt choices
