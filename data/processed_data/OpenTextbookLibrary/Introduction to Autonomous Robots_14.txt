a test tube that is nearly invisible can be picked up almost blindly when using a funnellike mechanism at your end-effector. Unfortunately, these tricks will most likely limit the versatility of your robot, requiring you to think about the problem and the users needs as a whole. Take-home lessons The best solution to a problem is a function of the available sensing, actuation, computation and communication abilities of the available platform. Usually, there exist trade-offs that allow you to solve a problem using a minimal set of resources but compromise performance characteristics such as speed, accuracy or reliability. Robotics problems are different from many problems in pure Artificial Intelligence, particularly those that do not deal with unreliable sensing or actuation. The unreliability of sensors, actuators and communication links require a probabilistic notion of the system and the ability to reason with uncertainty. Exercises .
