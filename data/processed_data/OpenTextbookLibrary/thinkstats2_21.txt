public research is often freely available. Good places to start include http: www.data.gov , andhttp: www.science. gov , and in the United Kingdom, http: data.gov.uk . Two of my favorite data sets are the General Social Survey at http: www3. norc.org gss website , and the European Social Survey at http: www. europeansocialsurvey.org . If it seems like someone has already answered your question, look closely to see whether the answer is justi ed. There might be aws in the data or the analysis that make the conclusion unreliable. In that case you could perform a di erent analysis of the same data, or look for a better source of data. If you nd a published paper that addresses your question, you should be able to get the raw data. Many authors make their data available on the web, but for sensitive data you might have to write to the authors, provide information about how you plan to use the data, or agree to certain terms of use.
