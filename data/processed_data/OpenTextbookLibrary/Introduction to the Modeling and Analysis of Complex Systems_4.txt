book as a mile-wide, inch-deep approach to teaching dynamical systems, cellular automata, networks, and the like. Then I realized that while students will learn a great deal about these topics, the real focus is learning about complexity and its hallmarks through particular mathematical models in which it occurs. In that respect, the book is remarkably deep and excellent at illustrating how complexity occurs in so many different contexts that it is worth studying in its own right. In other words, Sayama sort of rotates the axes from calculus , linear algebra , and so forth, so that the axes are self-organization , emergence , etc. This means that I would be equally happy to use the modeling chapters in a -level introduction to modeling course or to use the analysis chapters in an upper-level, calculus-based modeling course. The Python programming used throughout provides a nice introduction to simulation and gives readers an excellent sandbox in which to explore the topic. The exercises provide an excellent starting point to help readers ask and answer interesting questions about the models and about the underlying situations being modeled. The logical structure of the material takes maximum advantage of early material to support analysis and understanding of more dif cult models. The organization also means that students experiencing such material early in their academic careers will naturally have a framework for later studies that delve more deeply into the analysis and application of particular mathematical tools, like PDEs or networks.
