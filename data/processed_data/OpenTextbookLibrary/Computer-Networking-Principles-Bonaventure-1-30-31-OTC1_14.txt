by using two primitives : Data.request(source,destination,SDU). This primitive is issued by a user that speci es, as parameters, its (source) address, the address of the recipient of the message and the message itself. We will use Service Data Unit (SDU) to name the message that is exchanged transparently between two users of a service. Data.indication(source,destination,SDU). This primitive is delivered by a service provider to a user. It contains as parameters a Service Data Unit as well as the addresses of the sender and the destination users. When discussing the service provided in a computer network, it is often useful to be able to describe the interactions between the users and the provider graphically. A frequently used representation is the time-sequence diagram. In this chapter and later throughout the book, we will often use diagrams such as the gure below. A time-sequence diagram describes the interactions between two users and a service provider. By convention, the users are represented in the left and right parts of the diagram while the service provider occupies the middle of the diagram. In such a time-sequence diagram, time ows from the top, to the bottom of the diagram. Each primitive This service is called the connectionless service because there is no need to create a connection before transmitting any data in contrast with the connection-oriented service.

The dashed lines are used to represent the possible relationship between two (or more) primitives. Such a diagram provides information about the ordering
