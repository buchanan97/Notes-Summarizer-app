is Digit (c); return valid ; . MANIPULATING TEXT String Builder Java strings are said to be immutable; this means that a string value, once initialized, cannot be changed. Of course we have seen that a variable of type String can have one value and then through, say an assignment statement, have its value changed. Consider the statements String s " Good "; String d " day "; s d; After the rst statement is executed sreferences a location containing the word "Good" . As a result of the second statement the variable d references a location containing " day" . From the programmer's perspective the third statement clearly causes the value associated with sto change. The JVM performs the following steps when the third statement executes: another area of memory is allocated for s- large enough to hold the result of the catenation the contents of the string that scurrently refers to is copied into the new area ( "Good" is copied) the contents of the string that drefers to then copied into the new area ( " day" is copied) the variable sis changed so it references the new area. We can visualize the above steps with the following diagram. CHAPTER . VALIDATION AND TEXT MANIPULATION Figure : When a string variable gets a new value, a new area of memory is allocated. . MANIPULATING TEXT For many programming situations immutable strings work very well; for instance when a line of output is being established through catenation. However, if a program may do a great deal of string manipulation there is another class, String Builder , which for many operations does not have the same overhead as String.
