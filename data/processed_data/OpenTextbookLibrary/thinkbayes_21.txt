from 1994, whic h implies that Bag is from 1996. B: Bag is from 1996 and Bag from 1994. No w w e construct a table with a ro w for eac h h yp othesis and a column for eac h term in Ba y es's theorem: Prior Lik eliho o d P osterior p(H)p(Dj H)p(H) p(Dj H)p(Hj D) A ( )( ) B ( )( ) The rst column has the priors. Based on the statemen t of the problem, it is reasonable to c ho ose p(A) p(B) . The second column has the lik eliho o ds, whic h follo w from the information in the problem. F or example, if A is true, the y ello w M M came from the 1994 bag with probabilit y , and the green came from the 1996 bag with probabilit y . If B is true, the y ello w M M came from the 1996 bag with probabilit y , and the green came from the 1994 bag with probabilit y . Because the selections are indep enden t, w e get the conjoin t probabilit y b y m ultiplying. The third column is just the pro duct of the previous t w o. The sum of this column, , is the normalizing constan t. T o get the last column, whic h con tains the p osteriors, w e divide the third column b y the normalizing constan t. That's it. Simple, righ t? W ell, y ou migh t b e b othered b y one detail. I write p(Dj H) in terms of p ercen tages, not probabilities, whic h means it
