and double-click on it. Then to adjust Chrome, go to Settings Show advanced settings Customize fonts (button), and change at a minimum the default Sans-serif font to Symbola. Then restart Chrome. Unfortunately, adding fonts to (non-rooted) Android devices continues to be very dif cult. Worse, Android often fails to display even a box symbol l in the place of missing characters. If no available browser properly displays the symbols above, I recommend the pdf format. The unicode-safer version, however, should work on most systems. At some point I hope to gure out how to handle this font situation a little better using Javascript. This turns out, however, not to be straightforward, and progress has been slow. Technical considerations An Introduction to Computer Networks, Release I could have gone with Te X and Math Jax, but then I likely would have gotten rather too carried away with mathematical formulas. The character set above keeps things (relatively) simple. As of 2020 Math Jax renders better than it used to, but you still cannot copy and paste. The diagrams in the body of the text have now all been migrated to the vector-graphics .svg format, although a few diagrams rendered with line-drawing characters appear in the exercises. Most browsers now (2018) appear to support zooming in on .svg images, which is a signi cant step forward. A Note On the Cover The photo is of mahogany leaves, presumably Swietenia mahagoni .
