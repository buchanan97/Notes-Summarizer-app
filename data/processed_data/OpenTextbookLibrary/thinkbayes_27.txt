h w ord and ho w man y times it app ears. T o represen t a distribution in Python, y ou could use a dictionary that maps from eac h v alue to its probabilit y . I ha v e written a class called Pmf that uses a Python dictionary in exactly that w a y , and pro vides a n um b er of useful metho ds. I called the class Pmf in reference to a probabilit y mass function , whic h is a w a y to represen t a distribution mathematically . Pmf is de ned in a Python mo dule I wrote to accompan y this b o ok, thinkbayes.py . Y ou can do wnload it from http: thinkbayes.com thinkbayes.py . F or more information see Section . T o use Pmf y ou can imp ort it lik e this: from thinkbayes import Pmf The follo wing co de builds a Pmf to represen t the distribution of outcomes for a six-sided die: pmf Pmf() for x in , , , , , : pmf.Set(x, ) Chapter . Computational Statistics Pmf creates an empt y Pmf with no v alues. The Set metho d sets the probabilit y asso ciated with eac h v alue to . Here's another example that coun ts the n um b er of times eac h w ord app ears in a sequence: pmf Pmf() for word in word list: pmf.Incr(word, ) Incr increases the probabilit y asso ciated with eac h w ord b y . If a w ord is not already in the Pmf, it is added. I put probabilit y
