the two bars is , leaving some space between each pair. Finally, I adjust the axis to show only data between and weeks. Figure shows the result. Histograms are useful because they make the most frequent values immediately apparent. But they are not the best choice for comparing two distributions. In this example, there are fewer rst babies" than others," so some of the apparent di erences in the histograms are due to sample sizes. In the next chapter we address this problem using probability mass functions. . Summarizing distributions Summarizing distributions A histogram is a complete description of the distribution of a sample; that is, given a histogram, we could reconstruct the values in the sample (although not their order). If the details of the distribution are important, it might be necessary to present a histogram. But often we want to summarize the distribution with a few descriptive statistics. Some of the characteristics we might want to report are: central tendency: Do the values tend to cluster around a particular point? modes: Is there more than one cluster? spread: How much variability is there in the values? tails: How quickly do the probabilities drop o as we move away from the modes? outliers: Are there extreme values far from the modes? Statistics designed to answer these questions are called summary statistics . By far the most common summary statistic is the mean , which is meant to describe the central tendency of the distribution. If you have a sample of nvalues,xi, the mean, x, is the sum of the values divided by the number of values; in other words x n X ixi The words mean" and average" are
