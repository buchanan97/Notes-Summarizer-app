that ideal images are naturally described in re al-number coordinates. When you try to represent the image using pixels, many real-number co ordinates will map to the same integer pixel coordinates; they can all be considered as di erent names or aliases for the same pixel.) Antialiasing is a term for techniques that are designed to mitigate the e e cts of aliasing. Theideaisthatwhenapixelisonlypartiallycoveredbyasha pe, thecolorofthepixelshouldbe a mixture of the color of the shape and the color of the backgro und. When drawing a black line on a white background, the color of a partially covered pixel would be gray, with the shade of gray depending on the fraction of the pixel that is covered by the line. (In practice, calculating this area exactly for each pixel would be too di cult, so some approximate method is used.) Here, for example, is a geometric line, shown on the left, alo ng with two approximations of that line made by coloring pixels. The lines are greatly magni ed so that you can see the individual pixels. The line on the right is drawn using antialiasing, wh ile the one in the middle is not: CHAPTER . TWO-DIMENSIONAL GRAPHICS Note that antialiasing does not give a perfect image, but it c an reduce the jaggies that are caused by aliasing (at least when it is viewed on a normal scal e). There are other issues involved in mapping real-number coor dinates to pixels. For example, which point in a pixel should correspond to integer-valued c oordinates such as ( , )? The center of the pixel? One of the corners of the pixel? In general, we th ink of the numbers as
