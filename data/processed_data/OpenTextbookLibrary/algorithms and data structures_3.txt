The purpose of an artificial programming environment A program can be designed with the barest of tools, paper and pencil, or in the programmer's head. In the realm of such informal environments, a program design may contain vague concepts expressed in an informal notation. Before he or she can execute this program, the programmer needs a programming environment , typically a complex system with many distinct components: a computer and its operating system, utilities, and program libraries; text and program editors; various programming languages and their processors. Such real programming environments force programmers to express themselves in formal notations. Programming is the realization of a solution to a problem, expressed in terms of those operations provided by a given programming environment. Most programmers work in environments that provide very powerful operations and tools. The more powerful a programming environment, the simpler the programming task, at least to the expert who has achieved mastery of this environment. Even an experienced programmer may need several months to master a new programming environment, and a novice may give up
