expression . Regular expressions are string patterns that can be used for matching purposes. Regular expressions range from simple to very complex CHAPTER . VALIDATION AND TEXT MANIPULATION - at some time you may be interested in pursuing some more advanced expressions, but for the time being we list a few simpler patterns below. Note that and are used to specify any character within the brackets, " "is used to specify one or more of a preceding character, and -is used to specify a range of characters. required purpose pattern to match a comma "," to match a space " " to match multiple spaces " " to match a dash "-" to match a dash followed by a comma "-," to match a dash or a comma " -, " to match a digit " - " to match a letter " a-z A-Z " . MANIPULATING TEXT Example . Capitalize and compress words Suppose we have a line of text where words are separated by spaces. We want to form a new word which is the catenation of the original words and where only the rst letter of each word is is capitalized. For instance if the line is retail sales tax then the program creates the word Retail Sales Tax The following program uses the simple regular expression " "(a pattern for a single space) and the split method to split the line of text into an array of strings. Each word is then catenated in turn to the result (with its rst letter forced to be a capital letter). Listing : splitting text on a space 1public class Catenate Words public static void main ( String
