to a function, but not exactly. The difference is in the syntax used to call it. When you call a function (liketype()orlen()) you simply type its name, followed by a pair of bananas inside of which you put the arguments (separated by commas, if there s more than one). But when you call a method, you puta variablebefore a dot ( . ) and the method name, then the bananas. This is referred to as calling the methodonthe variable. Itsoundsmoreconfusingthanitis. Here sanexampleof.format() in action: . THE THREE KINDS IN PYTHON23 price of Christian Louboutin shoes message "Honey, I spent today!" print(message.format(price of Christian Louboutin shoes)) Takenoteofhowwewrite message.format insteadofjust format . This is because.format()is a method, not a function. We say that we are calling.format() on message, and passingprice of Christian Louboutin shoesas an argument. Also be sure to notice thedoublebananas )) at the end of that last line. We need both of them because in programming, every left-banana must match a corresponding right-banana. Since we re calling two functions methods on one line (print()and.format()), we had two left-bananas on that line. Each one needs a partner. As for the specifics of how.format()works, you ll see that the string variable you call it on may include pairs of curlies (squiggly braces). These are placeholders for where to stick the values of other variables in the output. Those variables are then included as arguments to the.format()method. The above code produces this output: Honey, I spent today! Often, instead of creating a new variable name to hold the preformatted string, we ll justprint()it literally, like this: print("Honey, I spent today!".format( price of Christian Louboutin shoes)) We re still actually calling.format()on a variable here,
