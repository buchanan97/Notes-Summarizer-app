be used, for example, by one device to alert another that data is available for it on the data bus. A fairly simple computer system might be organized like this: CPU Input Output Controller Data Address Control Empty Slot for future Expansion Memory Disk Drive Display Keyboard Network Interface Now, devices such as keyboard, mouse, and network interface can produce input that needs to be processed by the CPU. How does the CPU know that the data i s there? One simple idea, which turns out to be not very satisfactory, is for the CPU to k eep checking for incoming data over and over. Whenever it nds data, it processes it. This me thod is called polling, since the CPU polls the input devices continually to see whether th ey have any input data to report. Unfortunately, although polling is very simple, it is also v ery ine cient. The CPU can waste an awful lot of time just waiting for input. CHAPTER . THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE To avoid this ine ciency, interrupts are generally used instead of polling. An interrupt is a signal sent by another device to the CPU. The CPU responds to an interrupt signal by putting aside whatever it is doing in order to respond to the i nterrupt. Once it has handled the interrupt, it returns to what it was doing before the inte rrupt occurred. For example, when you press a key on your computer keyboard, a keyboard interru pt is sent to the CPU. The CPU responds to this signal by interrupting what it is doing, reading the key that you pressed, processing it, and then returning to the task it was
