and their representations and A BTis a matrix. Note that the added s and do not affect the other entries in the matrix during matrix multiplication. A matrix of this form is called a homogeneous transform . The inverse of an homogeneous transform can be constructed by inverting rotation and translation part independently, leading to A BRAP A BRT A BRT AP ( ) We have now established a convenient notation to convert points from one coordinate system to another. There are many possible ways this can be done, in particular how rotation can be represented (see below), but all can be converted from one form into the other. . Concatenation of Transformations Transformations can be combined: consider for example an arm with two links, reference frame A at the base, B at its first joint, and C at its end-effector. Given the transforms B CTand A BT, we can write AP A BTB CTCP A CTCP ( ) to convert a point in the reference frame of the end-effector to that of its base. As this works for rotation and translation operators independently, we can construct A CTas A CT A BRB CRA BRBPC APB ( ) where APBand BPCare the translations from A to B and from B to C , respectively. . Other representations for orientation So far, we have represented orientation by a matrix whose column vectors are orthogononal unit vectors describing the orientation of a coordinate system. Orientation is therefore represented with nine different values. We chose this representation mainly because it is the most intuitive to explain and is derived from simple geometry. .
