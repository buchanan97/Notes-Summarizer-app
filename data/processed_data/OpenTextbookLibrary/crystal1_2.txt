Earth proceeds from this day forward. Defining Data Science When people ask me what data scienceis, here s my go-to definition:deriving knowledge from data. But interpreting that phrase entails dissecting the difference between knowledge and data, two related but different terms. And that brings me to the data-to-wisdom hierarchy, depicted in Figure . Let s break it down. Figure :The data-to-wisdom hierarchy. . DEFINING DATA SCIENCE3 The real world Ultimately, what we re interested in is not data, but aspects of thereal world album sales and video views, stock prices and employment rates, hurricane trajectories and virus hot spots, or whatever. Data science can t really get off the ground until some sort ofdata acquisitiontakes place that records measurements of the real world in electronic form. This sounds obvious, but it s important to keep in mind, actually. No matter how much time we spend working with data,it s never the data that actually matters it s the real-world phenomenon the data represents.It might seem strange to say that data is merely incidental to a data scientist, but it s true. And I ve definitely seen more than one data scientist get so locked on to the data that they forget this basic truth. One important observation is that decisions about exactlywhich data to acquire from the real world are often crucial in how things are interpreted later on. To take an example close to home, let s say we re gathering information on college professors so we can gauge which universities have the highest performing faculty, and how this might be changing over the years. We choose some representative set of criteria to measure for each faculty member to
