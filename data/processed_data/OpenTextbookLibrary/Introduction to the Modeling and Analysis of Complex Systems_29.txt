knowledge, experience, and everyday cognitive processes. It is based on who you are, what you know, and how you see the world it is, ultimately, a personal thinking process, which is very dif cult to teach or to learn in a structured way. CHAPTER . FUNDAMENTALS OF MODELING Let me give you some examples to illustrate my point. The following gure shows an observation of a system over time. Can you create a mathematical model of this observation? Time Some quantity Figure : Observation example . This one should be quite easy, because the observed data show that nothing changed over time. The description no change is already a valid model written in English, but if you prefer writing it in mathematical form, you may want to write it as x(t) C ( ) or, if you use a differential equation, dx dt : ( ) Coming up with these models is a no brainer, because we have seen this kind of behavior many times in our daily lives. Here is another example. Can you create a mathematical model of this observation? Time Some quantity Figure : Observation example . . HOW TO CREATE A MODEL Now we see some changes. It seems the quantity monotonically increased over time. Then your brain must be searching your past memories for a pattern that looks like this curve you are looking at, and you may already have come up with a phrase like exponential growth, or more mathematically, equations like x(t) aebt( ) or dx dt bx: ( ) This may be easy or hard, depending on how much knowledge you have about such exponential growth models. In the meantime, if you
