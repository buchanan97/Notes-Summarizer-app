book to fully understand the awesome Python techniques that were used to make the program. You are the end user, you simply use the program and marvel at its cleverness and how it saved you so much manual e ort. You simply type the code into a le called words.py and run it or you download the source code from http: www.py4e.com code3 and run it. This is a good example of how Python and the Python language are acting as an intermediary between you (the end user) and me (the programmer). Python is a way for us to exchange useful instruction sequences (i.e., programs) in a common language that can be used by anyone who installs Python on their computer. So neither of us are talking to Python , instead we are communicating with each other through Python. The building blocks of programs In the next few chapters, we will learn more about the vocabulary, sentence structure, paragraph structure, and story structure of Python. We will learn about t he CHAPTER . WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN TO WRITE PROGRAMS? powerful capabilities of Python and how to compose those capabilities together t o create useful programs. There are some low-level conceptual patterns that we use to construct programs. These constructs are not just for Python programs, they are part of every progra mming language from machine language up to the high-level languages. input Get data from the outside world . This might be reading data from a le, or even some kind of sensor like a microphone or GPS. In our initial programs, our input will come from the user typing data on the keyboard. output Display the results of
