). There are several operators we do not discuss in this text. There are operators for every level from to ; we have not included any of the operators at levels , , , or . You could consult a reference such as Java in a Nutshell at some future date. Complex Expressions Expressions can be very complex each operand can itself be an expression that evaluates to true or false . Consider the following complex expr ession where a, b, c, d, x, z are numeric types: boolean answer a b c d x z The operator has two operands: a b c d and x z and each will evaluate to either true or false . If you look at the priorities of operators you will see the additions w ill be done first, followed by the relational operators, followed by , and finally the assignment to the variable answer . Some programmers prefer to include extra spaces and parentheses in expressions like the above in order to make the expression mor e readable, as in: boolean answer ((a b) (c d)) (x z) In this example the parentheses do not change the order of operations; rather, they may make it easier for someone to read . The Assignment Operator What is often referred to as the assignment stat ement is really a Java expression followed by a semicolon. The assignment operator, having a priority of , is usually the last operator to be evaluated. The assignment operator is right associative. That is, when several assignment operators appear in an expression they are evaluated performed from right to left. So, if you have the statement: int q (j
