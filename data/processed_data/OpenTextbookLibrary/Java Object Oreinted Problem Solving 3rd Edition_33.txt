Rectangle() . Note that it takes four arguments, representing the values that we want to give as the rectangle s x,y, length and width respectively. Note also how the Rectangle class s n Rectangles variable has a value of , representing that two Rectangle instances have been created. These are shown as members of the Rectangle class. It won t be obvious to you at this point, but n Rectangles is a value that has to be associated with the Rectangle class, not with its instances.
