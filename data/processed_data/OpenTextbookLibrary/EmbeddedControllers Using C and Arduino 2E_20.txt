desktop development, this is ready to test. .For embedded development, download the resulting executable to the target hardware (in our case, the Arduino development board). For the Arduino, steps , , and can be combined by selecting Build from the IDE menu. .Test the executable. If it doesn t behave properly, go back to step one. Summary Here are some things to keep in the back of your mind when learning C: C is terse. You can do a lot with a little code. As it allows you to do almost anything, a novice can get into trouble very quickly. It is a relatively thin language, meaning that most system functions are not part of the language per se, but come from link-time libraries. Function calls, function calls, and more function calls! Source code is free flow, not line oriented. A line of code is usually terminated with a semicolon. Shortcuts allow experts to create code that is almost indecipherable by normal programmers. All variables must be declared before use (not free flow as in Python). Variables can be global or local in scope. That is, a local variable can be known in one place of the program and not in another. Embedded Controllers Exercises . Write a C code comment that includes your name and the date.
