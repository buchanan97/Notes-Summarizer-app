the appropriate data structure(s). Your implementations should be fast enough that even les containing a million lines can be processed in a few seconds. . Read the input one line at a time and then write the lines out in reverse order, so that the last input line is printed rst, then the second last input line, and so on. . Read the rst lines of input and then write them out in reverse order. Read the next lines and then write them out in reverse Discussion and Exercises order. Do this until there are no more lines left to read, at which point any remaining lines should be output in reverse order. In other words, your output will start with the 50th line, then the 49th, then the 48th, and so on down to the rst line. This will be followed by the 100th line, followed by the 99th, and so on down to the 51st line. And so on. Your code should never have to store more than lines at any given time. . Read the input one line at a time. At any point after reading the rst lines, if some line is blank (i.e., a string of length ), then output the line that occured lines prior to that one. For example, if Line is blank, then your program should output line . This program should be implemented so that it never stores more than lines of the input at any given time. . Read the input one line at a time and write each line to the output if it is not a duplicate of some previous input line. Take special care so that a
