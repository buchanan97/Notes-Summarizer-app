years of training, of course, but they are not in any position to consider anywhere near the number of features that a program can look at. A DL program might consider thousands of features and have been trained on tens of thousands of cases. Also, while some, perhaps most, of the consultants knowledge will be explicit, some of it will be tacit (i.e. not articulable). It would amount to perhaps vague unspeakable hunches refined by years of experience. Tacit knowledge is a problem for the prior expert system AI approach: for somehow hunches would have to be converted into rules. But if the consultants themselves cannot put this tacit knowledge into words, how is this to be done? Then, going back to consultants, tacit knowledge itself is hard to produce, instill, and disseminate. If more medical consultants are needed in a health system, the newcomers will have to go through an apprenticeship with an accomplished consultant and years of training. Of course, reproducing a computer program can be done with the click of a mouse. A question is: which system is best at cancer diagnosis? With some forms of cancer, the ML programs provide the best diagnoses (K. Das et al. 2021). In sum, with cancer diagnoses, ML can do better than both prior AI expert systems, and human doctors. Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML inspired by the human brain, in particular by neurons and neural nets. Neurons are nerve cells in the brain that can communicate with other neurons using electrical signals and synapses. Specific neurons are triggered, or become excited, and that activation cascades through other neurons. This provides function to the nervous system to
