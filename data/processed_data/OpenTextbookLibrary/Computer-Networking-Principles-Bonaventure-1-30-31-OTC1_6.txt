In practice, the number of physical interfaces on a node will limit the size of a full-mesh network that can be built for a network containing nhosts,n (n ) 2links are required. This is possible when there are a few nodes in the same room, but rarely when they are located several kilometers apart The second possible physical organisation, which is also used inside computers to connect different extension cards, is the bus. In a bus network, all hosts are attached to a shared medium, usually a cable through a single interface. When one host sends an electrical signal on the bus, the signal is received by all hosts attached to the bus. A drawback of bus-based networks is that if the bus is physically cut, then the network is split into two isolated networks. For this reason, bus-based networks are sometimes considered to be dif cult to operate and maintain, especially when the cable is long and there are many places where it can break. Such a bus-based topology was used in early Ethernet networks. A third organisation of a computer network is a star topology. In such topologies, hosts have a single physical interface and there is one physical link between each host and the center of the star. The node at the center of the star can be either a piece of equipment that ampli es an electrical signal, or an active device, such as a piece In this book, we focus on networks that are used on Earth. These networks sometimes include satellite links. Besides the network technologies that are used on Earth, researchers develop networking techniques that could be used between nodes located on different
