We think this book is a testament to the bene ts and future possibilities of this kind of collaboration, the framework for which has been put in place by Richar d Stallman and the Free Software Foundation. How and why I came to use Python In 1999, the College Board s Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science exam was given in C for the rst time. As in many high schools throughout the country, the decision to change languages had a direct impact on the computer science curriculum at Yorktown High School in Arlington, Virginia, where I teac h. Up to this point, Pascal was the language of instruction in both our rst-y ear and AP courses. In keeping with past practice of giving students two years of exposure to the same language, we made the decision to switch to C in the rst-year course for the 1997- school year so that we would be in step with the Coll ege Board s change for the AP course the following year. Two years later, I was convinced that C was a poor choice to use for introduci ng students to computer science. While it is certainly a very powerful programming language, it is also an extremely di cult language to learn and teach. I found myself constantly ghting with C s di cult syntax and multiple ways of doi ng things, and I was losing many students unnecessarily as a result. Convinced there viii Preface had to be a better language choice for our rst-year class, I went looking for a n alternative to C . I needed a language that would run on the machines in our Linux lab as
