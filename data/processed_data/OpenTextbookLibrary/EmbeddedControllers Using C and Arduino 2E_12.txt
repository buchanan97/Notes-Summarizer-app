like x, volts, resistor7, or even I Wanna Go Home Now . C supports a handful of variable types. These include floating point or real numbers in two basic flavors: float, which is a bit number, and double, which is a higher precision version using bits. There are also a few integer types including char, which is bits, short int, which is bits, and long int, which is bits. As char is bits, it can hold to the 8th combinations, or different values. This is sufficient for a single ASCII character, hence the name. Similarly, a short int (or short, for short!) can hold to the 16th combinations, or , values. chars and ints may be signed or unsigned (signed, allowing negative values, is the default). There is also a plain old int, which might be either or bits, depending on which is most efficient for the compiler (to be on the safe side, never use plain old int if the value might require more than bits). Sometimes you might also come across special double long integers (also called long longs) that take up bytes as well as bit extended precision floats (as defined by the IEEE).

We shall examine these in a later segment. Variables must be declared before they are used. They cannot
