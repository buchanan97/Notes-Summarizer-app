who coined the term packet . It is perhaps worth noting that packets are buffers built of -bit bytes , and all hardware today agrees what a byte is (hardware agrees by convention on the order in which the bits of a byte are to be transmitted). -bit bytes are universal now, but it was not always so. Perhaps the last great non-byte-oriented hardware platform, which did indeed overlap with the Internet era broadly construed, was the DEC- , which had a -bit word size; a word could hold ve -bit ASCII characters. The early Internet speci cations introduced the term octet (an -bit byte) and required that packets be sequences of octets; non-octet-oriented hosts had to be able to convert. Thus was chaos averted. Note that there are still byte-oriented data issues; as one example, binary integers can be represented as a sequence of bytes in either big-endian orlittle-endian byte order ( Binary Data ).RFC 1700 speci es that Internet protocols use big-endian byte order, therefore sometimes called network byte order. Packets An Introduction to Computer Networks, Release Datagram Forwarding In the datagram-forwarding model of packet delivery, packet headers contain a destination address. It is up to the intervening switches or routers to look at this address and get the packet to the correct destination. In datagram forwarding this is achieved by providing each switch with a forwarding table of xdestination,next hop ypairs. When a packet arrives, the switch looks up the destination address (presumed globally unique) in its forwarding table and nds the next hop information: the immediate-neighbor address to which or interface by which the packet should be forwarded in order to bring it one step closer
