whic h encapsulates the Ba y esian up date framew ork. Suite is an abstract t yp e , whic h means that it de nes the in terface a Suite is supp osed to ha v e, but do es not pro vide a complete implemen tation. The Suite in terface includes Update and Likelihood , but the Suite class only pro vides an implemen tation of Update , not Likelihood . A concrete t yp e is a class that extends an abstract paren t class and provides an implemen tation of the missing metho ds. F or example, Monty extends Suite , so it inherits Update and pro vides Likelihood . If y ou are familiar with design patterns, y ou migh t recognize this as an example of the template metho d pattern. Y ou can read ab out this pattern at http: en.wikipedia.org wiki Template method pattern . Most of the examples in the follo wing c hapters follo w the same pattern; for eac h problem w e de ne a new class that extends Suite , inherits Update , and pro vides Likelihood . In a few cases w e o v erride Update , usually to impro v e p erformance. Exercises Exercise In Section I said that the solution to the co okie problem generalizes to the case where w e dra w m ultiple co okies with replacemen t. But in the more lik ely scenario where w e eat the co okies w e dra w, the lik eliho o d of eac h dra w dep ends on the previous dra ws. Mo dify the solution in this
