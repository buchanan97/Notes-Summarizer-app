even in the middle), yet they ll all have in mind the same luscious vanilla cones. One step towards conflating all these different expressions to the same root answer would be trimming the whitespace off the ends and converting everything to all lower-case. More surgical operations like removing punctuation or spaces in the middle is a bit trickier; stay tuned. CHAPTER . CALCULATIONS Return values Okay, you ve been in suspense long enough. Time for the bomb. First, we re going to add another phrase to our already lengthy function-calling mantra. You ll recall that we summarized this code (a function call): len(movie title) with this English: Wearecallingthelen()function,andpassingitmovie title as an argument. And we summarized this code (a method call): message.format(name, age) with this English: We are calling the.format()methodonthemessage variable, and passing itnameandageas arguments. Now, a third thing. We can use the equals sign with a variable name to capture the output of the function or method, instead of just printing it. The output of a function is called itsreturn value. We say that the.upper()methodreturnsan upper-case version of the string it was calledon. We can capture it like this: big and loud shop title.upper() . RETURN VALUES39 Thevariablebig and loudnowholdsthevalue"CARL'S ICE CREAM". Functions work similarly: width of sign len(shop title) Thewidth of signint now has the value (remember all those extraneous spaces); if we d trimmed first, we d have gotten : true width of sign len(shop title.strip()) print(true width of sign) The bomb I ve probably built this up too much, but I think you ll agree that the following output is pretty surprising: diva "Ariana Grande" diva.upper() print("I just love !".format(diva)) I just love Ariana Grande!
