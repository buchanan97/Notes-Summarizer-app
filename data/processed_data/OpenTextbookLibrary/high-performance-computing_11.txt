or a nightmare? Chances are good that it would turn out to be a nightmare, just like the previous night where you went back to the Middle Ages and put a jet engine on a horse. (Y ou have got to stop eating double pepperoni pizzas so late at night.) See link Chapter , Using Published Benchmarks, for details on the Linpack benchmark. Even if you can speed up the computational aspects of a processor infinitely fast, you still must load and store the data and instructions to and from a memory . Today s processors continue to creep ever closer to infinitely fast processing. Memory performance is increasing at a much slower rate (it will take longer for memory to become infinitely fast). Many of the interesting problems in high performance computing use a lar ge amount of memory . As computers are getting faster , the size of problems they tend to operate on also goes up. The trouble is that when you want to solve these problems at high speeds, you need a memory system that is lar ge, yet at the same time fast a big challenge. Possible approaches include the following: Every memory system component can be made individually fast enough to respond to every memory access request. Slow memory can be accessed in a round-robin fashion (hopefully) to give the ef fect of a faster memory system. The memory system design can be made wide so that each transfer contains many bytes of information. The system can be divided into faster and slower portions and arranged so that the fast portion is used more often than the slow one. Again, economics are the dominant
