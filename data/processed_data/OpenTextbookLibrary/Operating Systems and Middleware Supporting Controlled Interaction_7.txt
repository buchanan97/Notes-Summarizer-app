is dividing its xiv PREFACE time between computations, it needs to decide which ones to work on at any moment. With concurrent computations explained, Chapter introduces controlled interactions between them by explaining synchronization, which is control over the threads' relative timing. For example, this chapter explains how, when your email program sends a document to your word processor, the word processor can be constrained to read the document only after the email program writes it. One particularly important form of synchronization, atomic transactions, is the topic of Chapter . Atomic transactions are groups of operations that take place as an indivisible unit; they are most commonly supported by middleware, though they are also playing an increasing role in operating systems. Other than synchronization, the main way that operating systems control the interaction between computations is by controlling their access to memory. Chapter explains how this is achieved using the technique known as virtual memory. That chapter also explains the many other objectives this same technique can serve. Virtual memory serves as the foundation for Chapter 's topic, which is processes. A process is the fundamental unit of computation for protected access, just as a thread is the fundamental unit of computation for concurrency. A process is a group of threads that share a protection environment; in particular, they share the same access to virtual memory. The next three chapters move outside the limitations of a single computer operating in a single session. First, consider the document stored before a trip and available again after it. Chapter explains persistent storage mechanisms, focusing particularly on the le storage that operating systems provide. Second, consider the interaction between your email program and your
