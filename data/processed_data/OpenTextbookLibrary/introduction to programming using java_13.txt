t does this by repeatedly reading, orfetching , aninstructionfrommemoryandthencarryingout, or executing , thatinstruction. This process fetch an instruction, execute it, fetch anoth er instruction, execute it, and so on forever is called the fetch-and-execute cycle . With one exception, which will be covered in the next section, this is all that the CPU ever does. (This i s all really somewhat more complicated in modern computers. A typical processing chip these days contains several CPU cores, which allows it to execute several instructions si multaneously. And access to main memory is speeded up by memory caches, which can be more qui ckly accessed than main memory and which are meant to hold data and instructions that the CPU is likely to need soon. However, these complications don t change the basic operat ion.) A CPU contains an Arithmetic Logic Unit , or ALU, which is the part of the processor that carries out operations such as addition and subtractio n. It also holds a small number of registers , which are small memory units capable of holding a single num ber. A typical CPU might have or general purpose registers, which hold d ata values that are immediately accessible for processing, and many machine language instr uctions refer to these registers. For example, there might be an instruction that takes two number s from two speci ed registers, adds those numbers (using the ALU), and stores the result bac k into a register. And there might be instructions for copying a data value from main memo ry into a register, or from a register into main memory. The CPU also includes special purpose registers. The most im portant of these
