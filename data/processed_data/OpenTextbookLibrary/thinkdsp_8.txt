erent frequencies. The most important mathematical idea in this book is the discrete Fourier transform , or DFT , which takes a signal and produces its spectrum . The spectrum is the set of sinusoids that add up to produce the signal. And the most important algorithm in this book is the Fast Fourier transform , or FFT , which is an e cient way to compute the DFT. For example, Figure shows the spectrum of the violin recording in Figure . The x-axis is the range of frequencies that make up the signal. The y-axis shows the strength or amplitude of each frequency component. Chapter .

The lowest frequency component is called the fundamental frequency . The fundamental frequency of this signal is near Hz (actually a little lower, or at"). In this signal the fundamental frequency has the largest amplitude, so it is also the dominant frequency . Normally the perceived pitch of a sound is determined by the fundamental frequency, even if it is not dominant. The other spikes in the spectrum are at frequencies , 1320, 1760, and 2200, which are integer multiples of the fundamental. These components are called harmonics because they are musically harmonious with the fundamental: is the frequency of A5, one octave higher than the fundamental. An octave is a doubling in frequency. 1320 is approximately E6, which is a perfect fth above A5. If you are not familiar with musical intervals like "perfect fth", see https: en.wikipedia.org wiki Interval (music) . 1760 is A6, two octaves above the fundamental. 2200
