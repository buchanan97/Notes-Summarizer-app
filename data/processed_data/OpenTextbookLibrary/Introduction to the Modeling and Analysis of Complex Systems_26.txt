of models in mind, we can say that science is an endless effort to create models of nature, because, after all, modeling is the one and only rational approach to the unreachable reality. And similarly, engineering is an endless effort to control or in uence nature to make something desirable happen, by creating and controlling its models. Therefore, modeling occupies the most essential part in any endeavor in science and engineering. Exercise In the wet lawn scenario discussed above, come up with a few more alternative hypotheses that could explain both the wet lawn and the wet driveway without assuming that it rained. Then think of ways to nd out which hypothesis is most likely to be the real cause. This fact is deeply related to the impossibility of general system identi cation, including the identi cation of computational processes. CHAPTER . FUNDAMENTALS OF MODELING Exercise Name a couple of scienti c models that are extensively used in today s scienti c engineering elds. Then investigate the following: How were they developed? What made them more useful than earlier models? How could they possibly be wrong? How to Create a Model There are a number of approaches for scienti c model building. My favorite way of classifying various kinds of modeling approaches is to put them into the following two major families: Descriptive modeling In this approach, researchers try to specify the actual state of a system at a given time point (or at multiple time points) in a descriptive manner. Taking a picture, creating a miniature (this is literally a model in the usual sense of the word), and writing a biography of someone, all belong to this family
