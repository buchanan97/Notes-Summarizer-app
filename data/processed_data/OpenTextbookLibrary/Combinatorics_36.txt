The fact that someone has already flipped a coin once with a result of heads doesn t mean they ve used up that side of the coin so won t be able to flip heads again. In this chapter, we ll look at situations where we are choosing more than one item from a finite population in which every item is uniquely identified for example, choosing people from a family, or cards from a deck. The study of permutations and combinations has a very long history, particularly in India and China. Much of the older historical context that will be provided in this book comes from handouts that were developed by Prof. Randy Schwartz of Schoolcraft College in the U.S. He has made a study of the history of mathematics in a non-eurocentric context, for incorporation into his own classes, and his handouts on Combinations and Their Sums and Binomial Coe icients and Subsets are particularly relevant to this course. . Permutations We begin by looking at permutations, because these are a straightforward application of the product rule. The word permutation means a rearrangement, and this is exactly what a permutation is: an ordering of a number of distinct items in a line. Sometimes even though we have a large number of distinct items, we want to single out a smaller number
