Y ou can do wnload this example from http: thinkbayes.com train.py . F or more information see Section . . What ab out that prior? What ab out that prior?

In particular, w e c hose a uniform prior from to 1000, without m uc h justi cation for c ho osing 1000, or for c ho osing a uniform distribution. It is not crazy to b eliev e that a railroad compan y migh t op erate 1000 lo comotiv es, but a reasonable p erson migh t guess more or few er. So w e migh t w onder whether the p osterior distribution is sensitiv e to these assumptions. With so little data only one observ ation it probably is. Recall that with a uniform prior from to 1000, the mean of the p osterior is . With an upp er b ound of , w e get a p osterior mean of , and with an upp er b ound of 2000, the p osterior mean is . So that's bad. There are t w
