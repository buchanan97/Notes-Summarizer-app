it can be released in phases. This text should be looked at in the same way as a beta software release. I know there are mistakes, but I have the ability to correct them and rerelease the text. So comments are welcome. There is a separate set of appendices which should be available by mid -summer, 2015. I will update this forward with the URL address of those appendices once they are posted. If anyone is in real need of those appendices, I will send them in their current, incomplete, format. I can be contacted at ckann(at)gettysburg.edu. I will also release an answer guide when i t is completed, hopefully in the same mid-summer 2015 time frame. To request an answer guide will require a request from a professor or lecturer INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING at a school, and that the requestor be listed on the department web site for that school. Requests for this d ocument can be made to me at the same address as for the appendices. I hope the readers find this text useful.
