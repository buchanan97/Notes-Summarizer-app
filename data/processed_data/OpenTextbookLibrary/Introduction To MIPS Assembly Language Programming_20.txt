which doe s not in any way change that number. For example 00433 0433 . The same rule applies to binary. So the binary number 110110001 000110110001 . But why would anyone want to add extra zeros to the left of a number? Because to print out t he hex representation of a binary number, I need binary digits to do it. The binary number 110110001 only has binary digit in the high order byte. So to convert this number to binary it is necessary to pad it with left zeros, which have no effect on the number. Thus 10011 0001 0001 1011 0001 0x1 B1 in hex. Note that even the hex numbers are often paded with zeros, as the hex number 0x1 B1 is normally be written 0x01 B1, to get groupings of hex numbers (or bits). It is often the case where specific bits of a bit number need to be set. This is most easily done using a hex number. For instance, if a number is required where all of the bits except the right left most (or ) bit of a number is set, you can write th e number in binary as: 11111111111111111111111111111110 A second option is to write the decimal value as: 4294967295 Finally the hex value can be written as 0x FFFFFFFE In almost all cases where specific bits are being set, a hex representation of the number is the easiest to understand and use. Chapter . Character Representation All of the numbers used so far in this text have been binary whole numbers. While everything in a computer is binary, and can be represented as a binary value, binary whole numbers
