the promptfunction uses the string that we give it as the text to show in the dialog box. Values given to functions are called arguments . Differentfunctionsmightneed adifferentnumberordifferent types of arguments. The promptfunction isn t used much in modern web programming, mostly because you have no control over the way the resulting dialog looks, but it can be helpful in toy programs and experiments. Theconsole.logfunction In the examples, I used console.log to output values. Most Java Script systems (including all modern web browsers and Node.js) provide a console.log function that writes out its arguments to sometext output device. In browsers, the output lands in the Java Script console. This part of the browser interface is hidden by default, but most browsers open it when you press F12 or, on a Mac, command -option-I. If that does not work, search through the menus for an item named Developer Tools or similar. Though binding names cannot contain period characters, console.log does have one. This is because console.log isn t a simple binding, but an expression that retrieves the logproperty from the value held by the console binding. We ll find out exactly what this means in Chapter . Returnvalues Showing a dialog box or writing text to the screen is a side effect . Many functions are useful because of the side effects they produce. Functions may also produce values, in which case they don t need to have a side effect to be useful. For example, the function Math.max takes any amount of number arguments and gives back the greatest. console.log(Math.max( , )); Whenafunctionproducesavalue, itissaidto returnthatvalue. Anythingthat produces a value is an expression in Java Script, which means that function calls
