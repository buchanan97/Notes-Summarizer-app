which is the time between samples. np.fft is the Num Py module that provides functions related to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is an e cient algorithm that computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). make spectrum usesrfft , which stands for real FFT", because the Wave contains real values, not complex. Later we'll see the full FFT, which can handle complex signals. The result of rfft , which I call hs, is a Num Py array of complex numbers that represents the amplitude and phase o set of each frequency component in the wave. The result of rfftfreq , which I call fs, is an array that contains frequencies corresponding to the hs. To understand the values in hs, consider these two ways to think about complex numbers: A complex number is the sum of a real part and an imaginary part, often writtenx iy, whereiis the imaginary unit,p . You can think of x andyas Cartesian coordinates. A complex number is also the product of a magnitude and a complex exponential, Aei , where Ais the magnitude and is the angle in radians, also called the argument". You can think of Aand as polar coordinates. Each value in hscorresponds to a frequency component: its magnitude is proportional to the amplitude of the corresponding component; its angle is the phase o set. The Spectrum class provides two read-only properties, amps andangles , which return Num Py arrays representing the magnitudes and angles of the hs. When we plot a Spectrum object, we usually plot amps versusfs. Sometimes it is also useful to plot angles versusfs. Although it might be tempting to look at the real and imaginary parts of
