as an int type (a -byte integer). In the follow ing program (see line ) the value of s, a - byte integer, will be converted to an int value, a -byte integer. Listing : Example of widening This Java class declares a short variable, assigns it a value, and then assigns the value to a variable of type int public class Short To Int public static void main(String args) short s; int t; s ; t s; System.out.println ("s is: " s); System.out.println (" t is: " t); Java allows these widening conversions automatically: from byte to short, int, or long, float, or double from short to int, long, float, or double from int to long, float, or double from long to float or double from float to doubl e from char to int, long, float, or double Example Consider the expression ( - ) The sub -expression involves integers and the result is an integer producing a value of . Next in the evaluation will be the multiplication involving and ; note these are different types: int and double . Java automatically converts the to before the multiply is performed. Example Consider the expression ( ) The sub -expression, , involves integers and the result is an integer yieldi ng a value of . Next in the evaluation will be the multiplication involving and , which yields the int value of . Now we have plus . For this to be performed the is converted to and the final result is . Note that this would be conside red inaccurate (wrong) for the conversion of degree Celsius to Fahrenheit. To obtain a more accurate result should be used
