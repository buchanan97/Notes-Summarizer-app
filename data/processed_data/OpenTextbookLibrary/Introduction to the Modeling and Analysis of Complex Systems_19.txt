decision making process as a kind of deterministic dynamical system (in which either decisions themselves or their probabilities could be modeled deterministically). In this sense, game theory is linked to nonlinear dynamics. One of the many contributions game theory has made to science in general is that it demonstrated ways to model and analyze human behavior with great rigor, which has made huge in uences on economics, political science, psychology, and other areas of social sciences, as well as contributing to ecology and evolutionary biology. Later in the 20th century, it became clearly recognized that various innovative ideas and tools arising in those research areas were all developed to understand the behavior of systems made of multiple interactive components whose macroscopic behaviors were often hard to predict from the microscopic rules or laws that govern their dynamics. In the 1980s, those systems began to be the subject of widespread interdisciplinary discussions under the uni ed moniker of complex systems. The research area of complex systems science is therefore inherently interdisciplinary, which has remained unchanged since the inception of the eld. The recent developments of complex systems research may be roughly categorized into four topical clusters: pattern formation, evolution and adaptation, networks, and collective behavior. CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION Pattern formation is a self-organizing process that involves space as well as time. A system is made of a large number of components that are distributed over a spatial domain, and their interactions (typically local ones) create an interesting spatial pattern over time. Cellular automata , developed by John von Neumann and Stanis aw Ulam in the 1940s , are a well-known example of mathematical models that address pattern formation. Another modeling framework
