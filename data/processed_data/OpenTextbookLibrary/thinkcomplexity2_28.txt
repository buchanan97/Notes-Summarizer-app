and mis the number of edges. Continuing the analysis, what is the order of growth for is connected ? Chapter Graphs def is connected(G): start list(G) reachable reachable nodes(G, start) return len(reachable) len(G) Exercise In my implementation of reachable nodes , you might be bothered by the apparent ine ciency of adding allneighbors to the stack without checking whether they are already in seen . Write a version of this function that checks the neighbors before adding them to the stack. Does this optimization" change the order of growth? Does it make the function faster? Exercise There are actually two kinds of ER graphs. The one we generated in this chapter, G(n;p), is characterized by two parameters, the number of nodes and the probability of an edge between nodes. An alternative de nition, denoted G(n;m), is also characterized by two parameters: the number of nodes, n, and the number of edges, m. Under this de nition, the number of edges is xed, but their location is random. Repeat the experiments we did in this chapter using this alternative de nition. Here are a few suggestions for how to proceed: . Write a function called m pairs that takes a list of nodes and the number of edges,m, and returns a random selection of medges. A simple way to do that is to generate a list of all possible edges and use random.sample . . Write a function called make m graph that takesnandmand returns a random graph with nnodes andmedges. . Make a version of prob connected that uses make m graph instead of make random graph . . Compute the probability of connectivity for a range of values of
