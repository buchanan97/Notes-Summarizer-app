scale, self-organization is about time (in addition to scale). Namely, you call something selforganizing when you observe that the system spontaneously organizes itself to produce a nontrivial macroscopic structure and or behavior (or order, if you will) as time progresses. In other words, self-organization is a dynamical process that looks as if it were going against the second law of thermodynamics (which states that entropy of a closed system increases monotonically over time). Many physical, biological, and social systems show self-organizing behavior, which could appear mysterious when people were not aware of the possibility of self-organization. Of course, these systems are not truly going against the law of thermodynamics, because they are open systems that are driven by energy ow coming from and going to the outside of the system. In a sense, the idea of self-organization gives a dynamical explanation for emergent properties of complex systems. Self-organization is a dynamical process by which a system spontaneously forms nontrivial macroscopic structures and or behaviors over time. Around these two key ideas, there are several topical clusters, which are illustrated in Fig. . Let s quickly review them. Topical Clusters Nonlinear dynamics is probably the topical cluster that has the longest history, at least from as far back as the 17th century when Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz invented calculus and differential equations. But it was found only in the 20th century that systems that include nonlinearity in their dynamics could show some weird behaviors, such as chaos , (which will be discussed later). Here, nonlinearity means that the outputs of a system are not given by a linear combination of the inputs. In the context of system behavior, the
