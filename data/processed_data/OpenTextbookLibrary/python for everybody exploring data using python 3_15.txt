in just a few more chapters, you will be one of those programmers using Python to talk to the users of your program. Before we leave our rst conversation with the Python interpreter, you shoul d probably know the proper way to say good-bye when interacting with the inhabitants of Planet Python: good-bye Traceback (most recent call last): File " stdin " , line ,in module Name Error : name quotesingle.ts1good quotesingle.ts1 is not defined ifyou don quotesingle.ts1t mind, I need to leave File " stdin ", line if you don quotesingle.ts1 t mind, I need to leave Syntax Error : unterminated string literal (detected at line ) quit() You will notice that the error is di erent for the rst two incorrect attempts. T he second error is di erent because ifis a reserved word and Python saw the reserved word and thought we were trying to say something but got the syntax of the sentence wrong. CHAPTER . WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN TO WRITE PROGRAMS? The proper way to say good-bye to Python is to enter quit() at the interactive chevron prompt. It would have probably taken you quite a while to guess that one, so having a book handy probably will turn out to be helpful. Terminology: Interpreter and compiler Python is a high-level language intended to be relatively straightforward for humans to read and write and for computers to read and process. Other high-level languages include Java, C , PHP, Ruby, Basic, Perl, Java Script, and many more. The actual hardware inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU) does not understand any of these high-level languages. The CPU understands a language we call machine language . Machine
