x x)) (define (quadruple x) (double (double x))) (define (const5 ) ) Exercise When a function has multiple arguments, what simple but important criterion governs the names of those arguments? What are the parts of a function de nition? It has a name (above, double ,quadruple, and const5 ), which we ll represent as a symbol ( double , etc.); its formal parameter orargument has a name (e.g., x), which too we can model as a symbol ( x); and it has a body. We ll determine the body s representation in stages, but let s start to lay out a datatype for function de nitions: fundef :: (define-type Fun Def C fd C (name : symbol) (arg : symbol) (body : Expr C) ) What is the body? Clearly, it has the form of an arithmetic expression, and sometimes it can even be represented using the existing Arith C language: for instance, the body of const5 can be represented as (num C ) . But representing the body of doublerequires something more: not just addition (which we have), but also x . You are probably used to calling this a variable , but we will notuse that term for now. Instead, we will call it an identi er . I promise we ll return to this issue of nomenclature later REF .Do Now! Anything else? Finally, let s look at the body of quadruple . It has yet another new construct: a function application . Be very careful to distinguish between a function de nition , which describes what the function is, and an application , which uses it. These are uses. The argument (oractual parameter ) in the
