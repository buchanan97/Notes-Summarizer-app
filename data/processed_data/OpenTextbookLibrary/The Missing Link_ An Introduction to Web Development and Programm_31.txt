to provide you with the files used to create it (called source code) so you could make changes and compile your own, modified, executable program. Open source is growing in popularity but the concept has existed for quite some time. Recently, larger governments have begun to embrace free, open source solutions as a means to reduce costs and achieve modifications that customize programs to fit their needs. His - torically open source was viewed as a security risk as anyone could submit changes to the project, and it was feared that vulnerabilities or malicious code would be inserted. In fact, with so many users able to view and modify the files, it has actually made those with malicious intent less able to hide their modifications (sometimes called the many eyes approach to reliability). Development time has also been reduced as the community of developers on a popular open source project can greatly exceed that of a closed source solution with limited development staff. A popular acronym referring to these projects is FOSS Free, Open Source Software. As not all open source programs are free in terms of purchasing or licensing, FOSS in - dicates solutions that are free of costs as well as free to change.

While it is odd to think of a company giving away its creation for free, these companies generate revenue by building advertising into their software or offering premium services such as product support or contracting with clients to customize the product. Many companies will also offer only some tools as
