program until you get to something tha t works and that you understand. Beginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because they can t stand to delete a line of code (even if it s wrong). If it makes you feel better, copy your program into another le before you start stripping it down. Then you can paste the pieces back in a little bit at a time. The learning journey As you progress through the rest of the book, don t be afraid if the concepts don t seem to t together well the rst time. When you were learning to speak, it was not a problem for your rst few years that you just made cute gurgling noises. And it was OK if it took six months for you to move from simple vocabular y to simple sentences and took - more years to move from sentences to paragraphs, and a few more years to be able to write an interesting complete short story on your own. We want you to learn Python much more rapidly, so we teach it all at the s ame time over the next few chapters. But it is like learning a new language that takes time to absorb and understand before it feels natural. That leads to some confusion as we visit and revisit topics to try to get you to see the big picture while we are de ni ng the tiny fragments that make up that big picture. While the book is written linearly, and if you are taking a course it will progress in a linear fashio n, don t hesitate to be very nonlinear in how you approach
