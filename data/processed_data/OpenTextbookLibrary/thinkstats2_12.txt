book are available from https: github. com Allen Downey Think Stats2 . For information about downloading and working with this code, see Section . Once you download the code, you should have a le called Think Stats2 code nsfg.py . If you run it, it should read a data le, run some tests, and print a message like, All tests passed." Let's see what it does. Pregnancy data from Cycle of the NSFG is in a le called2002 Fem Preg.dat.gz ; it is a gzip-compressed data le in plain text (ASCII), with xed width columns. Each line in the le is a record that contains data about one pregnancy. . Data Frames The format of the le is documented in 2002 Fem Preg.dct , which is a Stata dictionary le. Stata is a statistical software system; a dictionary" in this context is a list of variable names, types, and indices that identify where in each line to nd each variable. For example, here are a few lines from 2002 Fem Preg.dct : infile dictionary column( ) str12 caseid 12s "RESPONDENT ID NUMBER" column( ) byte pregordr 2f "PREGNANCY ORDER (NUMBER)" This dictionary describes two variables: caseid is a -character string that represents the respondent ID; pregordr is a one-byte integer that indicates which pregnancy this record describes for this respondent. The code you downloaded includes thinkstats2.py , which is a Python module that contains many classes and functions used in this book, including functions that read the Stata dictionary and the NSFG data le. Here's how they are used in nsfg.py : def Read Fem Preg(dct file 2002 Fem Preg.dct , dat file 2002 Fem Preg.dat.gz ): dct thinkstats2.Read Stata
