The version on the right cuts o the fundamental to show the harmonics more clearly. Next we can use the Signal to make a Wave, and use the Wave to make a Spectrum: wave signal.make wave(duration , framerate 10000) spectrum wave.make spectrum() spectrum.plot() Figure shows two views of the result; the view on the right is scaled to show the harmonics more clearly. As expected, the highest peak is at the fundamental frequency, Hz, and there are additional peaks at harmonic frequencies, which are integer multiples of . But one surprise is that there are no peaks at the even multiples: , , etc. The harmonics of a triangle wave are all odd multiples of the fundamental frequency, in this example , 1000, 1400, etc. Another feature of this spectrum is the relationship between the amplitude and frequency of the harmonics. Their amplitude drops o in proportion to frequency squared. For example the frequency ratio of the rst two harmonics ( and Hz) is , and the amplitude ratio is approximately . The frequency ratio of the next two harmonics ( and 1000 Hz) is , and the amplitude ratio is approximately : : . This relationship is called the harmonic structure . Using an underscore as a variable name is a convention that means, I don't intend to use this value." Chapter . Harmonics Time (s) Figure :
