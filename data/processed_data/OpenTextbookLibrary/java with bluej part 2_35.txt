EXERCISES Exercises . Write a program that counts the number of digits in a string. The program must use a method that begins public static int count Digits(String line) It is possible for the method to be called with a null argument. For example, count Digits(null) . (a) Write the method count Digits so that it tests the argument to verify that it is not null. Use an assert statement. (b) Write the method count Digits so that it tests the argument to verify that it is not null. If it is null your code must throw an Illegal Argument Exception . . At some universities courses are coded in three parts separated by a punctuation character such as a dash. For instance "ACS-2814- " speci es a course 2814, section , o ered by the ACS department. Write a program that obtains a string from the end user and then determines if the string properly designates a course where there must be letters, a dash, digits, a dash, and more digits. . Modify the program Check Argument Value so that it does more error checking. That is, verify the value of mmis between and , and that the value of ddis appropriate for the month. . Write a program that accepts some words from
