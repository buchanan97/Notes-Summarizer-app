challenging, interesting, and (done right) fun. Iwrotethe rsteditionthisbookwiththegoalofidentifyin gsynchronization idioms and patterns that could be understood in isolation an d then assembled to solve complex problems. This was a challenge, because syn chronization code doesn t compose well; as the number of components increases , the number of interactions grows unmanageably. Nevertheless, I found patterns in the solutions I saw, and di scovered at least some systematic approaches to assembling solutions t hat are demonstrably correct. I had a chance to test this approach when I taught Operating Sy stems at Wellesley College. I used the rst edition of The Little Book of Semaphores along with one of the standard textbooks, and I taught Synchr onization as a concurrent thread for the duration of the course. Each week I gave the students a few pages from the book, ending with a puzzle, and sometimes a hint. I told them not to look at the hint unless they were stumped. I also gave them some tools for testing their solutions: a sma ll magnetic whiteboard where they could write code, and a stack of magnet s to represent the threads executing the code. The results were dramatic. Given more time to absorb the mate rial, students demonstrated a depth of understanding I had not seen be fore. More importantly, most of them were able to solve most of the puzzl es. In some cases they reinvented classical solutions; in other cases t hey found creative new approaches. ii Preface When I moved to Olin College, I took the next step and created a half-class, called Synchronization, which covered The Little Book of Semaphores and also the implementation of synchronization primitives in
