What would a distributive law of addition over multiplicati on look like? Is it a valid law in the algebra of numbers? .The distributive laws given in Figure .2are sometimes called the leftdistributive laws. The right distributive laws say that ( p q) r (p r) (q r) and that (p q) r (p r) (q r). Show that the right distributive laws are also valid laws of Boolean algebra. (Note: In practice, both the left an d the right distributive laws are referred to simply as the distributive laws, and bot h can be used freely in proofs.) .Show that p (q r s) (p q) (p r) (p s) for any propositions p,q, r, ands. In words, we can say that conjunction distributes over a dis junction of three terms. (Recall that the operator is called conjunction and is called disjunction.) Translate into logic and verify the fact that conjunction distributes over a disjunction of four terms. Argue that, in fact, conjun ction distributes over a disjunction of any number of terms. .There are two additional basic laws of logic, involving the tw o expression p Fand p T. What are the missing laws? Show that your answers are, in fact , laws. CHAPTER . LOGIC AND PROOF .For each of the following pairs of propositions,
