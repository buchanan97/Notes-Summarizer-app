a text editor to write the Python instructions into a le, which is called a script . By convention, Python scripts have names that end with .py. To execute the script, you have to tell the Python interpreter the name of the le. In a command window, you would type python hello.py as follows: cat hello.py print( quotesingle.ts1 Hello world! quotesingle.ts1 ) python hello.py Hello world! The is the operating system prompt, and the cat hello.py is showing us that the le hello.py has a one-line Python program to print a string. We call the Python interpreter and tell it to read its source code from the le hello.py instead of prompting us for lines of Python code interactively. You will notice that there was no need to have quit() at the end of the Python program in the le. When Python is reading your source code from a le, it knows to stop when it reaches the end of the le. What is a program? The de nition of a program at its most basic is a sequence of Python statements that have been crafted to do something. Even our simple hello.py script is a program. It is a one-line program and is not particularly useful, but in the strict est de nition, it is a Python program. It might be easiest to understand what a program is by thinking about a problem that a program might be built to solve, and then looking at a program that wo uld solve that problem.
