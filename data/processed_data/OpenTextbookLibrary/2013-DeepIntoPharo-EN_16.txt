and move the image to a different machine or operating system, a location will still resolve to the expected directory or le. Note that some le locations are speci c to the virtual machine. Opening read and write Streams Opening read and write Streams To open a stream on a le, just ask the reference for a read- or write-stream using the message write Stream orread Stream as follows: working stream working : File System disk working Directory. stream : (working 'foo.txt') write Stream. stream next Put All: 'Hello World'. stream close. stream : (working 'foo.txt') read Stream. stream contents. 'Hello World' stream close. Please note that write Stream overrides any existing le and read Stream throws an exception if the le does not exist. Forgetting to close stream is a common mistake, for which even advanced programmers regularly fall into. Closing a stream frees low level resources, which is a good thing to do. The messages read Stream Do: and write Stream Do: frees the programmer from explicitly closing the stream. Consider: working working : File System disk working Directory. working 'foo.txt' write Stream Do: :stream stream next Put All: 'Hello World' . working 'foo.txt' read Stream Do: :stream stream contents . Keep in mind that le may be easily overridden without giving any warning. Consider the following situation: working working : File System disk working Directory. working 'authors.txt' read Stream Do: :stream stream contents . 'stephane alexandre damien jannik' The le authors.txt may be simply overridden with: File System disk working Directory 'authors.txt' write Stream Do: :stream stream next Put All: 'bob joe' . Reading back the le may give an odd result: working working : File System
