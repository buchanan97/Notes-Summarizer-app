perimeter of another circle that runs around a stationary circle . We performed this computation with a floating-point package that lets us pick precision P (i.e. the number of bits in the mantissa). The resulting pictures look a bit chaotic, with a behavior we have come to associate with fractals even if the mathematics of generating them is completely different, and linear recurrences computed without error would look much more regular. Notice that the first two images are generated by the same formula, with a single bit of difference in the precision used. The whim of this -bit difference in precision changes the image entirely.
