. .If the value in memory location is the number , continue with instruction . .Add the value of memory location to memory location . .Add the number to the value of memory location . .Continue with instruction . .Output the value of memory location . Although that is already more readable than the soup of bits, it is still rather obscure. Using names instead of numbers for the instructions and memory locations helps. Set total to . Set count to . loop Set compare to count . Subtract from compare . If compare is , continue at end . Add count to total . Add to count . Continue at loop . end Output total . Can you see how the program works at this point? The first two lines give two memory locations their starting values: totalwill be used to build up the result of the computation, and countwill keep track of the number that we are currently looking at. The lines using compareare probably the most confusing ones. The program wants to see whether countis equal to to decide whether it can stop running. Because our hypothetical machine is rather primitive, it can test only whether a number is zero and make a decision based on that. It therefore uses the memory location labeled compare to compute the value ofcount - and makes a decision based on that value. The next two lines add the value of countto the result and increment countby every time the program decides that countis not yet. Here is the same program in Java Script: let total , count ; while (count ) total count; count ; console.log(total); This version gives us
