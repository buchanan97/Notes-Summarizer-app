a longstanding goal to nd better ways to present competition and congestion in the classroom. Another feature is the detailed chapter on queuing disciplines. One thing this book makes little attempt to cover in detail is the application layer; the token example included is SNMP. While SNMP actually makes a pretty good example of a self-contained application, my recommendation to instructors who wish to cover more familiar examples is to combine this text with the appropriate application documentation. Although the book is continuously updated, I try very hard to ensure that all editions are classroomcompatible. To this end, section renumbering is avoided to the extent practical, and, except between different editions, existing exercises are never renumbered. New exercises are regularly inserted, but with fractional ( oating point) numbers. Existing integral exercise numbers have been given a trailing . , to reduce confusion between exercise , say, and . For those interested in using the book for a traditional networks course, I with some trepidation offer the following set of core material. In solidarity with those who prefer alternatives to a bottom-up ordering, I emphasize that this represents a setand not a sequence . An Overview of Networks Selected sections from Ethernet Basics , particularly switched Ethernet Selected sections from Wi-Fi Selected sections from Packets Abstract Sliding Windows IP version and or IPv6 Selected sections from Routing-Update Algorithms , probably including the distance-vector algorithm Selected sections from Large-Scale IP Routing UDP Transport TCP Transport Basics TCP Reno and Congestion Management With some care in the topic-selection details, the above can be covered in one semester along with a survey of selected important network applications, or the basics of network programming, or
