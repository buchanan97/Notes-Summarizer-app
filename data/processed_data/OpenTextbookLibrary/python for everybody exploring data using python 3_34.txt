oating point result: minute minute The division operator in Python would divide two integers and truncate the result to an integer: minute minute To obtain the same answer in Python use oored ( integer) division. . EXPRESSIONS minute minute In Python integer division functions much more as you would expect if you entered the expression on a calculator. Expressions Anexpression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are a ll legal expressions (assuming that the variable xhas been assigned a value): x x If you type an expression in interactive mode, the interpreter evaluates it and displays the result: But in a script, an expression all by itself doesn t do anything! This is a commo n source of confusion for beginners. Exercise : Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see what they do: x x Order of operations When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation depends on the rules of precedence . For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember the rules: Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated rst, ( - ) is , and ( ) ( - ) is . You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute ) , even if it doesn t change the result. CHAPTER . VARIABLES, EXPRESSIONS, AND STATEMENTS Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so is , not ,
