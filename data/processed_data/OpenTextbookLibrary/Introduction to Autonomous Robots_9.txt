for the left and the right branch, both going back and forth. As ants return faster on the shorter branch there will be more pheromones present on the short branch once a new ant arrives from the nest. Every now and then, ants give the longer path another shot, eventually finding new food sources. What looks like intelligent behavior at the swarm level, is essentially achieved by a pheromone sensor that occasionally fails. A modern industrial robot would solve the problem completely differently: it would first acquire some representation of the environment in the form of a map populated with obstacles, and then plan a path using an algorithm. Which solution to achieve a certain desired behavior is best depends on the resources that are available to the designer. We will now study a more elaborate problem for which many, more or less efficient, solutions exist. . A roboticists problem Imagine the following scenario. You are a robot in a maze-like environment such as a cluttered warehouse, hospital, or office building. There is a chest full of gold coins hidden somewhere inside. Unfortunately, you don t have a map of the maze. In case you find the chest, you may only take a couple of coins at a time, and bring them to the exit door where your car is parked. Think about a strategy that will allow you to harvest as many coins in the shortest time as possible. Think about the cognitive and perception capabilities you would use. Now discuss alternative strategies: if you could not use these capabilities, what would you do? I.e., what if you were blind, or had no memory of the past? These are
