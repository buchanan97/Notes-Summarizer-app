value to where it was invoked. The value returned is assigned t o password Length . Note the name of the method is followed by parentheses even though no argument is passed this is necessary so the Java compiler knows that the code specifies a method name. Listing Finding the length of a string public class Using String Length public static void main(String args) variable password is of type String variable password Length is of type int String password "my123 Password"; use the length() method int password Length password. length(); Display the string and its length System.out.println("password is"); System.out.println(password); System.out.println("length is"); System.out.println(pas sword Length); Figure : Showing the string and its length Example, getting the character at a specific position In many applications where strings are being processed a specific character is expected in a specific position. For instance, a social insurance number can be coded as digits, a hyphen, digits, a hyphen followed by more digits. The following program obtains the character at position . The method char At( ) returns the character at a specific position to the point where th e method is invoked. The method char At( ) must always have an argument value (the position) passed to it. For Java, positions within a string begin at and so the first hyphen should be at position . Note in the program, at line , shown here: char first Hyphen sin.char At( ); how the method is invoked (a period separates the name of the string, sin, from the name of the method) and how the value is passed to the method (in parentheses as an argument value).
