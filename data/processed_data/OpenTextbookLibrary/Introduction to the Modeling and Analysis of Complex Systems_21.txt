and social media over the last decade. With these information technology infrastructures, researchers are now able to obtain high-resolution, high-throughput data about how people are connected to each other, how they are communicating with each other, how they are moving geographically, what they are interested in, what they buy, how they form opinions or preferences, how they respond to disastrous events, and the list goes on and on. This allows scientists to analyze the structure of networks at multiple scales and also to develop dynamical models of how the collectives behave. Similar data-driven movements are also seen in biology and medicine (e.g., behavioral ecology, systems biology, epidemiology), neuroscience (e.g., the Human Connectome Project ), and other areas. It is expected that . TOPICAL CLUSTERS these topical areas will expand further in the coming decades as the understanding of the collective dynamics of complex systems will increase their relevance in our everyday lives. Here, I should note that these seven topical clusters are based on my own view of the eld, and they are by no means well de ned or well accepted by the community. There must be many other ways to categorize diverse complex systems related topics. These clusters are more or less categorized based on research communities and subject areas, while the methodologies of modeling and analysis traverse across many of those clusters. Therefore, the following chapters of this textbook are organized based on the methodologies of modeling and analysis, and they are not based on speci c subjects to be modeled or analyzed. In this way, I hope you will be able to learn the how-to skills systematically in the most generalizable way, so that you can
