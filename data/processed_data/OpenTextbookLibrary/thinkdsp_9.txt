is approximately C , which is a major third above A6. These harmonics make up the notes of an A major chord, although not all in the same octave. Some of them are only approximate because the notes that make up Western music have been adjusted for equal temperament (see http: en.wikipedia.org wiki Equal temperament ). Given the harmonics and their amplitudes, you can reconstruct the signal by adding up sinusoids. Next we'll see how. . Signals Signals I wrote a Python module called thinkdsp.py that contains classes and functions for working with signals and spectrums1. You will nd it in the repository for this book (see Section ). To represent signals, thinkdsp provides a class called Signal , which is the parent class for several signal types, including Sinusoid , which represents both sine and cosine signals. thinkdsp provides functions to create sine and cosine signals: cos sig thinkdsp.Cos Signal(freq , amp , offset ) sin sig thinkdsp.Sin Signal(freq , amp , offset ) freq is frequency in Hz. ampis amplitude in unspeci ed units where is de ned as the largest amplitude we can record or play back. offset is aphase o set in radians. Phase o set determines where in the period the signal starts. For example, a sine signal with offset starts at sin , which is . With offset pi it starts at sin , which is . Signals have an add method, so you can use the operator to add them: mix sin sig cos sig The result is a Sum Signal , which represents the sum of two or more signals. A Signal is basically a Python representation of a mathematical function. Most
