Plugging ev erything in to the online calculator at http: cvdrisk.nhlbi. nih.gov calculator.asp , I nd that m y risk of a heart attac k in the next y ear is ab out , less than the national a v erage. That v alue is a conditional probabilit y , b ecause it is based on a n um b er of factors that mak e up m y condition. The usual notation for conditional probabilit y is p(Aj B) , whic h is the probabilit y of A giv en that B is true. In this example, A represen ts the prediction that I will ha v e a heart attac k in the next y ear, and B is the set of conditions I listed. Conjoin t probabilit y Conjoin t probabilit y is a fancy w a y to sa y the probabilit y that t w o things are true. I write p(Aand B) to mean the probabilit y that A and B are b oth true.
