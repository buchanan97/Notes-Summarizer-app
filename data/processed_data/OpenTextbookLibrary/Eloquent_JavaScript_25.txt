nullorundefined , not if it is some other value that can be converted to false. Often, this is preferable to the behavior of . console.log( ); console.log( ?? ); console.log(null ?? ); The operator works similarly but the other way around. When the value to its left is something that converts to false, it returns that value, and otherwise it returns the value on its right. Another important property of these two operators is that the part to their right is evaluated only when necessary. In the case of true X , no matter what Xis even if it s a piece of program that does something terrible the result will be true, and Xis never evaluated. The same goes for false X , which is false and will ignore X. This is called short-circuit evaluation . The conditional operator works in a similar way. Of the second and third values, only the one that is selected is evaluated. Summary We looked at four types of Java Script values in this chapter: numbers, strings, Booleans, and undefined values. Such values are created by typing in their name ( true,null) or value ( ,"abc"). You can combine and transform values with operators. We saw binary operators for arithmetic ( ,-, , , and ), string concatenation ( ), comparison ( ,! , ,! , , , , ), and logic ( , ,??), as well as several unary operators ( -to negate a number, !to negate logically, and typeofto find a value s type) and a ternary operator ( ?:) to pick one of two values based on a third value. This gives you enough information to use Java Script as
