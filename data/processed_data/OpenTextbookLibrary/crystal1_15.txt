of code and moviein another.) Underscores are often used as pseudo-spaces, but no other weird punctuation marks are allowed in a variable s name. And while we re on the subject, let me encourage you toname your variables well. This means that each variable name should reflect exactlywhat the value that it stores represents. Example: if a variable is meant to store the rating (in stars ) that an IMDB user gave to a movie, don t name itmovie. Name itrating. (Or even better,movie rating.) Trust me: when you re working on a complex program, there s enough hard stuff to think about without confusing yourself (and your colleagues) by close-but-not-exact variable names. Now remember that a variable has three things a name, value, and type. The first two explicitly appear in the line of code itself. As for the type, how does Python know thatrevolutionshould be an int? Simple: it sa number with no decimal point. As a sanity check, we can ask Python to tell us the variable s type explicitly, by writing this code: type(revolution) If this line of code is executed after the previous one is executed, Python responds with: int So there you go. Here s another code snippet (a term that just means some lines of code I m focusing on, which are generally only part of a larger program ): Oh, and another rule: a variable name can tstartwith a digit. Sor2d2is a legal variable name, but not007bond. And I fully own up to the fact that therevolutionvariable isn t named very well. I chose it to make a different point shortly. CHAPTER .
