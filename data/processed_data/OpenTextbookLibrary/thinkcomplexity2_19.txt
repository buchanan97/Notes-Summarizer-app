to make a list. Adding edges works pretty much the same way: G.add edge( 'Alice ', 'Bob ') G.add edge( 'Alice ', 'Chuck ') G.add edge( 'Bob ', 'Alice ') G.add edge( 'Bob ', 'Chuck ') And we can use edges to get the list of edges: list(G.edges()) ( 'Alice ', 'Bob '), ( 'Alice ', 'Chuck '), ( 'Bob ', 'Alice '), ( 'Bob ', 'Chuck ') Network X provides several functions for drawing graphs; draw circular arranges the nodes in a circle and connects them with edges: nx.draw circular(G, node color COLORS , node size 2000, with labels True) That's the code I use to generate Figure . The option with labels causes the nodes to be labeled; in the next example we'll see how to label the edges. Network X To generate Figure , I start with a dictionary that maps from each city name to its approximate longitude and latitude: positions dict(Albany (- , ), Boston (- , ), NYC (- , ), Philly (- , )) Since this is an undirected graph, I instantiate nx.Graph : G nx.Graph() Then I can use add nodes from to iterate the keys of positions and add them as nodes: G.add nodes from(positions) Next I'll make a dictionary that maps from each edge to the corresponding driving time: drive times ( 'Albany ', 'Boston '): , ( 'Albany ', 'NYC '): , ( 'Boston ', 'NYC '): , ( 'NYC ', 'Philly '): Now I can use add edges from , which iterates the keys of drive times and adds them as edges: G.add edges from(drive times) Instead of draw circular , which arranges the nodes in a circle,
