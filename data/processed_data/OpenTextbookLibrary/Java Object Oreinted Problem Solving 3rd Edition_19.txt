of applications, high-level languages use symbols and notation that make them easily readable by humans. For example, arithmetic operations in Java make use of familiar operators such as and and , so that arithmetic expressions look more or less the way they do in algebra. So, to take the average of two numbers, you might use the expression ( a b ) The problem is that computers cannot directly understand such expressions. In order for a computer to run a program, the program must rst be translated into the computer s machine language , which is the language understood by its CPU or microprocessor. Each type of microprocessor has its own particular machine language. That s why when you buy software it runs either on a Macintosh, which uses the Power-PC chip, or on a Windows machine, which uses the Pentium chip, but not on both. When a Platform independence program can run on just one type of chip, it is known as platform dependent . In general, machine languages are based on the binary code , a twovalued system that is well suited for electronic devices. In a binary representation scheme, everything is represented as a sequence of s and s, which corresponds closely to the computer s electronic on and off states. For example, in binary code, the number would be repre8 CHAPTER Computers, Objects, and Java sented as 1101. Similarly, a particular address in the computer s memory might be represented as 01100011, and an instruction in the computer s instruction set might be represented as 001100. The instructions that make up a computer s machine language are very simple and basic. For example, a typical machine
