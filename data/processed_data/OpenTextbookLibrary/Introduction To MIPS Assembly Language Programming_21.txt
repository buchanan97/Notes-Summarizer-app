do n ot represent the universe of numbering systems that exists in computers. Two representations that will be covered in the next two sections are character data and integer data. Though computers deal use binary to represent data, h umans usually deal with information as symbolic alphabetic and numeric data. So to allow computers to handle user readable alpha numeric data , a system to encode characters as binary numbers was created. That system is called American Standard Code for I nformation Interchange (ASCII ) . In ASCII all character ASCII is limited to just characters, and is thus too limited for many applications that deal with internationalization using multiple languag es and alphabets. Representations, such as Unicode, have been developed to handle these character sets, but are complex and not needed to understand MIPS Assembly. So this text will limit all character representations to ASCII. INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING are represented by a number from - , stored in bits. The ASCII encodings are shown in the following table. Table - : ASCII Table Using this table, it is possible to encode a string such as "Once " in ASCII characters as the hexadecimal number 0x4 F6 E63653 (capital O 0x4 F, n 0x6 E, c 0x53, e 0x65 ). Numbers as character data are also represented in ASCII. Note t he number is 0x D or 1101 . However the value of the character string " " is 0x3133. When dealing with data, it is important to remember what the data represents. Character numbers are represented using binary values, but are very different from the ir binary numbers. Finally, some of the interesting patterns in
