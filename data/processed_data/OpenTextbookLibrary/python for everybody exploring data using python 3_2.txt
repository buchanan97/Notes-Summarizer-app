object-oriented programming, using web services, parsing XML and JSON data, creating and using databases using Structured Query Language, and visualizing data. The ultimate goal of all of these changes is to shift from a Computer Science to an Informatics focus and to only include topics into a rst technology class that can be useful even if one chooses not to become a professional programmer. Except, of course, for this line. iv Students who nd this book interesting and want to further explore should look at Allen B. Downey s Think Python book. Because there is a lot of overlap between the two books, students will quickly pick up skills in the additional a reas of technical programming and algorithmic thinking that are covered in Think Python . And given that the books have a similar writing style, they should be able to move quickly through Think Python with a minimum of e ort. As the copyright holder of Think Python , Allen has given me permission to change the book s license on the material from his book that remains in this book f rom the GNU Free Documentation License to the more recent Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license. This follows a general shift in open documentation licenses moving from the GFDL to the CC-BY-SA (e.g., Wikipedia). Using the CC-BY-SA license maintains the book s strong copyleft tradition while mak ing it even more straightforward for new authors to reuse this material as they see t. I feel that this book serves as an example of why open materials are so impo rtant to the future of education, and I want to thank Allen B. Downey and Cambridge University
