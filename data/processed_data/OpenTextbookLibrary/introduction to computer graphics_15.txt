there, since it is stored in the list of shapes that the i mage contains. If you delete the tree, the house will still be in the image, just as it was before you a dded the tree. Furthermore, you should be able to select one of the shapes in the image and move it or change its size, so drawing programs o er a rich set of editing operations that are not po ssible in painting programs. (The reverse, however, is also true.) A practical program for image creation and editing might com bine elements of painting and drawing, although one or the other is usually dominant. For e xample, a drawing program might allow the user to include a raster-type image, treating it as one shape. A painting program might let the user create layers, which are separate image s that can be layered one on top of another to create the nal image. The layers can then be manip ulated much like the shapes in a drawing program (so that you could keep both your house and y our tree in separate layers, even if in the image of the house is in back of the tree). Two well-known graphics programs are Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator .Photoshop is in the category of painting programs, while Illustrator is more of a drawing program. In the world of free software, the GNU image-processing progra m,Gimp, is a good alternative to Photoshop , while Inkscape is a reasonably capable free drawing program. Short introdu ctions to Gimp and Inkscape can be found in Appendix C . The divide between raster and vector graphics also appears i n the eld
