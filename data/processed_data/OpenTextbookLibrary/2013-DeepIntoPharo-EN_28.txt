experimenting. Basic Concepts Socket A remote communication involves at least two system processes exchanging some data bytes through a network. Each process accesses the network Sockets through at least one socket (see Figure ). A socket can then be de ned as aplug on a communication network . Figure : Inter-Process Remote Communication Through Sockets Sockets are used to establish a bidirectional communication: they allow both sending and receiving data. Such interaction can be done according to communication protocols which are encapsulated by sockets. On the Internet and other networks such as ethernet LANs1, two basic protocols widely used are TCP IP and UDP IP . TCP IP vs. UDP IP TCP IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol (TCP for short). TCP use guarantees a reliable communication (no data loss). It requires that applications involved in the communication get connected before actually communicating. Once a connection is established interacting parties can send and receive an arbitrary amount of bytes. This is often referred to as a stream communication . Data reach the destination in the same order of their sending. UDP IP stands for User Datagram Protocol Internet Protocol (UDP for short). Datagrams are chunks of data whose size cannot exceed KB. UDP is an unreliable protocol for two reasons. First, UDP does not guarantee that datagrams will actually reach their destination. The second reason is that the reception order of multiple datagrams from a single sender to the receiver may arrive in an arbitrary order. Nevertheless, UDP is faster than TCP since no connection is required before sending data. A typical use of UDP is heart-beating as used in server-based social application, where clients need to notify
