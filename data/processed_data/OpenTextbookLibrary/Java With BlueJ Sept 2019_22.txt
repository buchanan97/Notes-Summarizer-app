important to us yet): When is being evaluated and if th e first operand is false , then the result must be false and so the second operand is not evaluated. When is being evaluated and if the first operand is true , then the result must be true and so the second operand is not evaluated. other operators There are other operators ( , , and ) that you may be interested in learning about subsequent to this course. These, amongst other features, are discussed in Java in a Nutshell . Relational Operators There are a number of operators defined for compari ng one value to another. These are summarized in the table below (assume x and y are of type int). These operations evaluate to a boolean ( true or false ): Relational operators operator meaning example less than x y greater than x less than or equal to y greater than or equal to x y equal to x y ! not equal to x ! Make special n ote that is the operator used to test for equality, and ! is used to test two operands to determine if they are not equal. Listing i llustrates the use of relational operators. Later in the chapter on control structures we will use relational operators in many examples. Listing : Comparing char values public class Compare Number public static void main(String args) i1 and i2 are two char variables int i1 ; int i2 ; Display i1 and i2 Display true or false according to whether they are equal or not System.out.println("The int values"); System.out.println(i1); System.out.println(i2); System.out.println("Testing i1 i2"); System.out.println(i1 i2); System.out.println("Testing i1 i2"); System.out.println(i1 i2); System.out.println("Testing i1
