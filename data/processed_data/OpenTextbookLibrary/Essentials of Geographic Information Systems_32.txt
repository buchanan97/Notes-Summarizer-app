refers to the factor of reduction of the world so it fits on a map. Map scale can be represented by text, a graphic, or some combination of the two. For example, it is common to see one inch represents one kilometer or something similar written on a map to give map users an idea of the scale of the map. Map scale can also be portrayed graphically with what is called a scale bar. Scale bars are usually used on reference maps and allow map users to approximate distances between locations and features on a map, as well as to get an overall idea of the scale of the map. Figur e Map Scale from a United States Geological Survey (USGS) Topographic Map The representative fraction (RF) describes scale as a simple ratio. The numerator, which is always set to one (i.e., ), denotes map distance and the denominator denotes ground or real -world distance. One of the benefits of using a representative fraction to describe scale is that it is unit neutral. In other words, Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org books Saylor.org any unit of measure can be used to interpret the map scale. Consider a map with an RF of : , . This means th at one unit on the map represents , units on the ground. Such units could be inches, centimeters, or even pencil lengths; it really does not matter. Map scales can also be described as either small or large. Such descriptions are usually made in reference to representative fractions and the amount of detail represented on a map. For instance, a map with an RF of : , is considered a large -scale
