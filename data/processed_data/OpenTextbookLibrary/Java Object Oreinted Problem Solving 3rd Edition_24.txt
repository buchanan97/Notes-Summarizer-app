Despite this list of attractive features, perhaps the best reason for choosing Java as an introductory programming language is its potential for bringing fun and excitement into learning how to program. There are few other languages in which a beginning programmer can write a computer game or a graphically based application that can be distributed on a Web page to just about any computer in the world. The simplicity of Java s design and its easily accessible libraries bring such accomplishments within reach of the most novice programmers. For example, we will work on projects throughout the text that involve games and puzzles. We start out in Chapter by designing very simple games that involve storing and retrieving data. As we learn more sophisticated programming techniques, we gradually build more complexity into the games and puzzles. For example, we learn how to create interactive, two-person games in Chapter . In Chapter , we develop some games and puzzles that are played on virtual game boards. Finally, in Chapter we learn how to introduce games with multiple players on different computers.

What Is Object-Oriented Programming? Java is an object-oriented (OO) language, and this book takes an objectoriented approach to programming. So before beginning our discussion of Java, it is important that we introduce some of the underlying concepts involved in object-oriented programming. We need to talk about what an object is, how objects are grouped into
