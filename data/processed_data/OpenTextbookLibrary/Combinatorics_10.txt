particular city? Is there a delivery route that visits every city in a particular area, without repetition? Given a collection of project topics and a group of students each of whom has expressed interest in some of the topics, is it possible to assign each student a unique topic that interests them? A city has bus routes all of which begin and end at the bus terminal, but with different schedules, some of which overlap. What is the least number of buses (and drivers) required in order to be able to complete all of the routes according to the schedule? Create a schedule for a round-robin tournament that uses as few time slots as possible. Some of these questions you may only be able to answer for particular kinds of graphs. Graph theory is a relatively young branch of mathematics. Although some of the problems and ideas that we will study date back a few hundred years, it was not until the 1930s that these individual problems were gathered together and a unified study of the theory of graphs began to develop. . Ramsey Theory Ramsey theory takes its name from Frank Plumpton Ramsey (1903 1930) , a British mathematician who died at the tragically young age of . Ramsey was a logician. A result that he considered a minor lemma in one of his logic papers now bears the name Ramsey s Theorem and was the basis for this branch of mathematics. Its statement requires a bit of graph theory: given ccolours and fixed sizes n1, ,n c, there is an integerr R(n1, ,n c)such that for any colouring the edges of of a complete graph on r vertices,
