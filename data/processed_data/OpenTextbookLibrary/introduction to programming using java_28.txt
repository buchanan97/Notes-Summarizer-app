to add better support for some of those langu ages. And this improvement to the JVM has in turn made possible some new features in Java. I should also note that the really hard part of platform-inde pendence is providing a Graphical User Interface with windows, buttons, etc. t hat will work on all the platforms that support Java. You ll see more about this problem in Section . Fundamental Building Blocks of Programs There are two basic aspects of programming: data and instructions. To work with data, you need to understand variables andtypes; to work with instructions, you need to understand control structures andsubroutines . You ll spend a large part of the course becoming familiar with these concepts. Avariable is just a memory location (or several consecutive locations treated as a unit) that has been given a name so that it can be easily referred to a nd used in a program. The programmer only has to worry about the name; it is the compile r s responsibility to keep track of the memory location. As a programmer, you just need to keep in mind that the name refers to a kind of box in memory that can hold data, even though you don t have to know where in memory that box is located. In Java and in many other programming languages, a variable h as atypethat indicates what sort of data it can hold. One type of variable might hold i ntegers whole numbers such as , - , and while another holds oating point numbers numb ers with decimal points such as , - , or .
