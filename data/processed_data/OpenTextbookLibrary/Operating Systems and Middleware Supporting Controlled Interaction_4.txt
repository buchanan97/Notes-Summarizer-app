don't compromise each other's reliability. The exciting challenge, then, is supporting controlled interaction. This includes support for computations that share a single computer and interact with one another, as your email and word processing programs do. It also includes support for data storage and network communication. This book describes how all these kinds of support are provided both by operating systems and by additional software layered on top of operating systems, which is known as middleware. xi xii PREFACE Audience If you are an upper-level computer science student who wants to understand how contemporary operating systems and middleware products work and why they work that way, this book is for you. In this book, you will nd many forms of balance. The high-level application programmer's view, focused on the services that system software provides, is balanced with a lower-level perspective, focused on the mechanisms used to provide those services. Timeless concepts are balanced with concrete examples of how those concepts are embodied in a range of currently popular systems. Programming is balanced with other intellectual activities, such as the scienti c measurement of system performance and the strategic consideration of system security in its human and business context. Even the programming languages used for examples are balanced, with some examples in Java and others in C or C . (Only limited portions of these languages are used, however, so that the examples can serve as learning opportunities, not stumbling blocks.) Systems Used as Examples Most of the examples throughout the book are drawn from the two dominant families of operating systems: Microsoft Windows and the UNIX family, including especially Linux and Mac OS X. Using this range of systems promotes
