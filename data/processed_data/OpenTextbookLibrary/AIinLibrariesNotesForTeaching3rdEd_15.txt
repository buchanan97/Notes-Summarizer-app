be used in conjunction with massive compute power search and ranking of actual books in libraries would be able to be improved. So, the promise was of a Universal Library, with improved search and ranking of the sources. Unfortunately, the Google Book Project got mired in difficulties of one kind or another, mainly legal, and, as of 2023, it seems to have drifted off into limbo (Somers 2017; Howard 2017). The work does continue, but in a somewhat slower and piecemeal fashion. We cannot pretend that this is a good result, but modern practices have rendered it less of a total disaster than it might have been. Most published books today are written on word processors on computers. Even if they are not produced that way, they are usually in electronic form prior to being printed (if, indeed, they are printed). The authors or publishers may or may not make the electronic form available to the world at large. Authors write books to have them read. Publishers print books to have them read (and sold or licensed). The parties concerned have incentives. So, one way or another, these electronic forms should become available. Separately, physical documents themselves are perhaps not so important as they once were. The indexed Web is around billion pages (de Kunder 2022), and Google estimated that the number of physical books they needed to scan was around million. The Web, the Internet, is a lot larger than the combined book collections in libraries. There is a distinction or consideration that should be mentioned here: that between digitization and transcription (or decoding).
