eight different colours (blue, yellow, pink, green, purple, orange, white, and black). The shirts can have an image on the front, and a slogan on the back. She has come up with three images, and five slogans. To stock her show room, Chlo wants to produce a single sample of each kind of shirt that she will be offering for sale. The shirts cost her each to produce. How much are the samples going to cost her (in total)? SOLUTION. To solve this problem, observe that to determine how many sample shirts Chlo will produce, we can consider the size as one aspect, and the style (including colour, image, and slogan) as the other. There are n1 3sizes. So the number of samples will be three times n2, wheren2is the number of possible styles. We now break n2down further: to determine how many possible styles are available, you can divide this into two aspects: the colour, and the decoration (image and slogan). There are n2, 8colours. So the number of styles will be eight times n2, , wheren2,2is the number of possible decorations (combinations of image and slogan) that are available. We can break n2,2down further: to determine how many possible decorations are available, you divide this into the two aspects of image and slogan. There are n2, , 3possible images, . Basic Counting Techniques andn2, , 5possible slogans, so the product rule tells us that there are n2, possible combinations of image and slogan (decorations). Putting all of this together, we see that Chlo will have to create ( ( )) sample t-shirts. As each one costs , her total cost will be 1440. Notice that finding exactly two
