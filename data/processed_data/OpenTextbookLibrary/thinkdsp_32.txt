anything. The parameter, self , is a Wave object. seg length is the number of samples in each segment. window is a Hamming window with the same length as the segments. iandjare the slice indices that select segments from the wave. step is the o set between segments. Since step is half of seg length , the segments overlap by half. Figure shows what these overlapping windows look like. spec map is a dictionary that maps from a timestamp to a Spectrum. Inside the while loop, we select a slice from the wave and apply the window; then we construct a Spectrum object and add it to spec map . The nominal time of each segment, t, is the midpoint. Then we advance iandj, and continue as long as jdoesn't go past the end of the Wave. Finally, the method constructs and returns a Spectrogram. Here is the de nition of Spectrogram: class Spectrogram(object): def init (self, spec map, seg length): self.spec map spec map self.seg length seg length Like many init methods, this one just stores the parameters as attributes. Spectrogram provides plot , which generates a pseudocolor plot with time along the x-axis and frequency along the y-axis. And that's how Spectrograms are implemented. Chapter . Non-periodic signals Exercises Solutions to these exercises are in chap03soln.ipynb . Exercise Run and listen to the examples in chap03.ipynb , which is in the repository for this book, and also available at http: tinyurl.com thinkdsp03 . In the leakage example, try replacing the Hamming window with one of the other windows provided by Num Py, and see what e ect they have on leakage.
