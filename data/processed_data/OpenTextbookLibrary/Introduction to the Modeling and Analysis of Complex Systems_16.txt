consciousness) are called emergent properties of the systems. Despite its long history of discussion and debate, there are still a number of different de nitions for the concept of emergence in complex systems science. However, the one thing that is common in most of the proposed de nitions is that the emergence is about the system s properties at different scales . If you observe a property at a macroscopic scale that is fundamentally different from what you would naturally expect from microscopic rules, then you are witnessing emergence. More concisely, emergence is a nontrivial relationship between the system s properties at different scales. This de nition was proposed by complex systems scientist Y aneer Bar-Y am . I will adopt this de nition since it is simple and consistent with most of the de nitions proposed in the literature. . COMPLEX SYSTEMS IN A NUTSHELL Figure : Visual, organizational map of complex systems science broken into seven topical areas. The three circles on the left (Nonlinear Dynamics, Systems Theory, and Game Theory) are the historical roots of complex systems science, while the other four circles (Pattern Formation, Evolution and Adaptation, Networks, and Collective Behavior) are the more recently studied topical areas. Created by the author and available from Wikipedia . CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION Emergence is a nontrivial relationship between the properties of a system at microscopic and macroscopic scales. Macroscopic properties are called emergent when it is hard to explain them simply from microscopic properties. Another key idea of complex systems science is self-organization , which is sometimes confused with emergence. Some researchers even use these terms almost interchangeably. One clear distinction, though, is that, while emergence is about
