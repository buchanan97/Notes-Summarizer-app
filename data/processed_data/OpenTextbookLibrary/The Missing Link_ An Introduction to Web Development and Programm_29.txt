on, what folder it looks for files in, its name, or other related features, look to the httpd.conf file. From the php.in file you can control elements like which modules are installed and enabled for your system, how much data scripts are allowed to consume, and more. Similarly your My SQL config file determines what port it listens on, which user it runs as on your server, what your admin account s credentials are, and more. Changes to these files typically require you to restart your web server (in our case, for apache or PHP changes), or at least the service that you are changing (in our case, My SQL changes). This can be done using the control panel if you are using a combination program like Wamp , or by using your operating system s service tools or by using system commands at a command prompt. Restarting Wamp in a GUI operating system like Windows can be done be right clicking on Wamp s icon in the tray. In a Cent OS server, the same effect can be achieved by typing service httpd restart. If all else fails, you can always physically restart the machine (referred to as bouncing ), but this is something you will want to avoid on a live system as it will cause a much longer period of down time. If you use installer packages, or a combo installer like Wamp , you will probably get by initially without making any changes to these files. Binary installers however will not know where or how to make changes to config files and you will need to follow the instructions to edit these files by hand to
