language if you re going to treat it like C or Pascal? I was reminded of a similar situation that existed when Pascal was the predominant CS1 language. Back then the main hurdle for beginners was procedural abstraction learning the basic mechanisms of procedure call vi and parameter passing and learning how to design programs as a collection of procedures. Oh! Pascal! , my favorite introductory text, was typical of a procedures early approach. It covered procedures and parameters in Chapter , right after covering the assignment and I O constructs in Chapter . It then covered program design and organization in Chapter . It didn t get into loops, if-else, and other structured programming concepts until Chapter and beyond. Today, the main hurdle for beginners is the concept of object abstraction . Beginning programmers must be able to see a program as a collection of interacting objects and must learn how to decompose programming problems into well-designed objects. Object orientation subsumes both procedural abstraction and structured programming concepts from the Pascal days. Teaching objects-early takes a top-down approach to these three important concepts. The sooner you begin to introduce objects and classes, the better the chances that students will master the important principles of object orientation. Java is a good language for introducing object orientation. Its object model is better organized than C . In C it is easy to work around or completely ignore OO features and treat the language like C. In Java there are good opportunities for motivating the discussion of object orientation. For example, it s almost impossible to discuss GUI-based Java applications without discussing inheritance and polymorphism. Thus rather than using contrived examples of
