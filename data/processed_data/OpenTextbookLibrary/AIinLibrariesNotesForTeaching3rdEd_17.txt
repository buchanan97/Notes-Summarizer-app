text can be spoken aloud. That is one part of what the Kurzweil machines, mentioned above, do. This is not trivial, by any manner of means, but it is also not a challenging AI problem. Obviously, text-to30 speech computer programs need to know the language of the text and how it is to be spoken (its pronunciation). Machine Translation Computer text, from a source natural language, can be translated by computer into other languages. This used to be done in an expert systems style of AI. There would be a dictionary between the source and target languages, grammar rules for both languages, and programmers would try to figure out translation rules that algorithms could use to get from one language to the other. The modern approach would be to used ML and DL. This relies on existing (human) translations between texts. These come from a variety of sources; for example, the United Nations provides translations into six languages of all its texts. The Bible has been translated into many languages, although it does have the drawback of having a very specific and distinctive written style. Google Translate uses the DL program Google Neural Machine Translation . At a first cut, this is what it does. There are a number of texts that have been translated, by human translators, from one language to another, say from English to French (and French to English). To translate from English to French the Neural D.L. will find all the existing occurrences of the relevant sentence, phrase, or word, in English and look up how they been translated by the human translators. Then it will favor what seems to be the best translation. Making the
