is a legal expression: print , , Well, that s not what we expected at all! Python interprets , , as a comma-separated list of three integers, which it prints consecutively. This is t he rst example we have seen of a semantic error: the code runs without producing an error message, but it doesn t do the right thing. Variables One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables . A variable is a name that refers to a value. Theassignment statement creates new variables and gives them values: message "What s up, Doc?" n pi This example makes three assignments. The rst assigns the string "What s up, Doc?" to a new variable named message . The second gives the integer 17ton, and the third gives the oating-point number topi. Notice that the rst statement uses double quotes to enclose the string. In general, single and double quotes do the same thing, but if the string contains a single quote (or an apostrophe, which is the same character), you have to use double quotes to enclose it. Variable names and keywords A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arr ow pointing to the variable s value. This kind of gure is called a state diagram because it shows what state each of the variables is in (think of it as the var iable s state of mind). This diagram shows the result of the assignment statements: message n pi"What s up, Doc?" The print statement also works with variables. print message What s up, Doc? print n print pi In each case the
