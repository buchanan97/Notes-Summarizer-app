text immediately following (i.e., in the part you re reading right now) or is something you can determine for yourself by running a program. If you just read on, you ll see the answer without having thought about it (or not see it at all, if the instructions are to run a program), so you will get to neither (a) test your knowledge, nor (b) improve your intuitions. In other words, these are additional, explicit attempts to encourage active learning. Ultimately, however, I can only encourage it; it s up to you to practice it. The Language of This Book The main programming language used in this book is Racket. Like with all operating systems, however, Racket actually supports a host of programming languages, so you must tell Racket which language you re programming in. You inform the Unix shell by writing a line like ! bin sh at the top of a script; you inform the browser by writing, say, !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "- W3 C DTD HTML EN" Similarly, Racket asks that you declare which language you will be using. Racket languages can have the same parenthetical syntax as Racket but with a different semantics; the same semantics but a different syntax; or different syntax and semantics. Thus every Racket program begins with lang followed by the name of some language: by default, it s Racket (written as racket ). In this book we ll almost always use the In Dr Racket v. , go to Language, then Choose Language, and select Use the language declared in the source .language plai-typed . When we deviate we ll say so explicitly, so unless indicated otherwise, put lang plai-typed at
