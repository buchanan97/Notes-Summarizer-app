that components above a given cuto frequency are attenuated (that is, reduced in magnitude) by a factor. high pass applies a high-pass lter, which means that it attenuates components below the cuto . band stop attenuates components in the band of frequencies between two cuto s. This example attenuates all frequencies above by : Chapter . Sounds and signals Wave Spectrum Signal Figure : Relationships among the classes in thinkdsp . spectrum.low pass(cutoff , factor ) A low pass lter removes bright, high-frequency sounds, so the result sounds mu ed and darker. To hear what it sounds like, you can convert the Spectrum back to a Wave, and then play it. wave spectrum.make wave() wave.play( temp.wav ) Theplay method writes the wave to a le and then plays it. If you use Jupyter notebooks, you can use make audio , which makes an Audio widget that plays the sound. Wave objects There is nothing very complicated in thinkdsp.py . Most of the functions it provides are thin wrappers around functions from Num Py and Sci Py. The primary classes in thinkdsp are Signal, Wave, and Spectrum. Given a Signal, you can make a Wave. Given a Wave, you can make a Spectrum, and vice versa. These relationships are shown in Figure . A Wave object contains three attributes: ysis a Num Py array that contains the values in the signal; tsis an array of the times where the signal was evaluated or sampled; and framerate is the number of samples per unit of time. The unit of time is usually seconds, but it doesn't have to be. In one of my examples, it's days. Wave also provides three read-only properties:
