of Linux operating systems. We will utilize Linux, the pre - dominant choice. Developed by Linus Torvalds in the early 1990s while he was a student, Linux was cre - ated so Linus could access UNIX systems at his university without relying on an operating system. As his project became more robust, he decided to share it with others, seeking input but believing it would remain a more personal endeavor. What he could not have predicted was the community that would come together and participate in helping shape it into what is today. As the basis of a large number of Linux-based operating systems (or flavors of Linux), the Linux core can be found around the world, even in the server rooms of its competitors like Microsoft. HTTP Server Apache Apache is an open source web server originally developed for UNIX systems. Now sup - ported on most platforms including UNIX, Linux, Windows, and Mac, Apache is one of the most utilized server applications. First developed in 1995, Apache follows a similar open source approach as Linux, allowing users to expand on the software and contribute to the community of users. The user group around Apache developed The Apache Foundation, which maintains a library of solutions for web services.
