too, have to be modeled as a series of bits to be able to exist inside the computer. The way Java Script does this is based on the Unicodestandard. This standard assigns a number to virtually every character you would ever need, including characters from Greek, Arabic, Japanese, Armenian, and so on. If we have a number for every character, a string can be described by a sequence of numbers. And that s what Java Script does. There s a complication though: Java Script s representation uses bits per string element, which can describe up to 216different characters. However, Unicode defines more characters than that about twice as many, at this point. So some characters, such as many emoji, take up two character positions in Java Script strings. We ll come back to this in Chapter . Strings cannot be divided, multiplied, or subtracted. The operator canbe used on them, not to add, but to concatenate to glue two strings together. The following line will produce the string "concatenate" : "con" "cat" "e" "nate" String values have a number of associated functions ( methods) that can be used to perform other operations on them. I ll say more about these in Chapter . Strings written with single or double quotes behave very much the same the only difference lies in which type of quote you need to escape inside of them. Backtick-quoted strings, usually called template literals , can do a few more tricks. Apart from being able to span lines, they can also embed other values. half of is When you write something inside in a template literal, its result will be computed, converted to a string, and included
