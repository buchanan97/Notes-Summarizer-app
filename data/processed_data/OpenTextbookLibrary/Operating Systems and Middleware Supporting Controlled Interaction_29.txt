middleware CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION by explaining transactions, which are commonly supported by middleware. Atransaction is a unit of computational work for which no intermediate state from the middle of the computation is ever visible. Concurrent transactions are isolated from seeing each other's intermediate storage. Additionally, if a transaction should fail, the storage will be left as it was before the transaction started. Even if the computer system should catastrophically crash in the middle of a transaction's execution, the storage after rebooting will not re ect the partial transaction. This prevents results of a half-completed transaction from becoming visible. Transactions are incredibly useful in designing reliable information systems and have widespread commercial deployment. They also provide a good example of how mathematical reasoning can be used to help design practical systems; this will be the chapter where I most prominently expect you to understand a proof. Even threads that have no reason to interact may accidentally interact, if they are running on the same computer and sharing the same memory. For example, one thread might accidentally write into memory being used by the other. This is one of several reasons why operating systems provide virtual memory , the topic of Chapter . Virtual memory refers to the technique of modifying addresses on their way from the processor to the memory, so that the addresses actually used for storing values in memory may be di erent from those appearing in the processor's load and store instructions. This is a general mechanism provided through a combination of hardware and operating system software. I explain several di erent goals this mechanism can serve, but the most simple is isolating threads in one process from
