the corollary that we can sometimes explain complicated behavior in the real world using simple models. As I explain in Chapter , complexity science is at the center of a slow shift in the practice of science and a change in what we consider science to be. xii Chapter Preface Studying complexity science provides an opportunity to learn about diverse physical and social systems, to develop and apply programming skills, and to think about fundamental questions in the philosophy of science. By reading this book and working on the exercises you will have a chance to explore topics and ideas you might not encounter otherwise, practice programming in Python, and learn more about data structures and algorithms. Features of this book include: Technical details Most books about complexity science are written for a popular audience. They leave out technical details, which is frustrating for people who can handle them. This book presents the code, the math, and the explanations you need to understand how the models work. Further reading Throughout the book, I include pointers to further reading, including original papers (most of which are available electronically) and related articles from Wikipedia and other sources. Jupyter notebooks For each chapter I provide a Jupyter notebook that includes the code from the chapter, additional examples, and animations that let you see the models in action. Exercises and solutions At the end of each chapter I suggest exercises you might want to work on, with solutions. For most of the links in this book I use URL redirection. This mechanism has the drawback of hiding the link destination, but it makes the URLs shorter and less obtrusive. Also, and more importantly, it
