point at every possible orientation. For example, a bicycle wheel can only roll along one direction and turn on the spot. Moving the bicycle wheel orthogonally to its direction of motion is not possible, unless it is forcefully dragged ( skidding ). Importantly, not having three degrees of freedom does not imply that some poses in the plane are unreachable it may just require additional movements to achieve them! A good analogue are figures on a chess-board. For example, a knight can reach every cell on a chess-board but might require multiple moves to do so. This is similar to a car, which can parallel park using back-and-forth motions. Instead, a bishop can only reach either black or white fields on the board, based upon its starting position. Similar reasoning applies to aerial and underwater robots. Here, the position of the robot is affected by the position and orientation of its thrusters, either in the form of jets or propellers. Things become complicated quickly, however, as the dynamics of the system are subject to fluid-dynamic and aero-dynamic effects, which also change as a function of the size of the robot. This book will not go into the details of flying and swimming robots, but the general principles of localization and planning will be applicable to them as well. Think about possible wheel, propeller and thruster configurations. Don t limit yourself to robots, but consider also street and aerial vehicles and be creative if you can think about a setup that makes sense, i.e., allows for reasonable mobility somebody has already built it and analyzed it. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? For manipulating arms, Cartesian Do Fs refer
