happened in the first place the author of the previous, useless line, probably wanted the variable itself to permanently have its leading spaces removed. Simply calling.lstrip()on the variable won t do that, but putting the revised value back in the same blue box on the memory diagram will. Chapter Scales of measure In the last chapter, we learned the Python verbiage for how to do arithmetic operations. In this one, we zoom out and ask: when does it actually makesenseto use those operations? The answer turns out to be: not always. Another way to phrase this distinction is in terms ofsyntaxvs.semantics. Syntax concerns the rules for combining various symbols in a programming (or other) language. Semantics concerns the meaningof those symbols. This isn t something a programming language can tell us. Only a human who understands what all those symbols refer to can determine when a particular combination actually relates to something meaningful. The four scales of measure Everyvariable1wecollectcanhavevariousvalues, andthenatureof information it contains can be described by itsscale of measure. Note that our use of the termvariablein this chapter is different than how we used it in chapter (e.g., p. ) and throughout chapter . In this chapter, a variable is normally some measurable aspect ofeveryobject in our study. We might recruit participants to a research experiment, and record their race, weight, and favorite breakfast cereal. These would be our three variables. Each of the three will constitutemanyvalues, since our group of participants will have many races, weights, and cereals. In programming terms, they will eventually becomeaggregatedata types of some kind. CHAPTER . SCALES OF MEASURE There are four such scales of measure2, and each one determines which kinds of
