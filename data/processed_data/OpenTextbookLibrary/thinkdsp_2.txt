to create one. After forking, you'll have your own repository on Git Hub that you can use to keep track of code you write while working on this book. Then you can clone the repo, which means that you copy the les to your computer. Or you could clone my repository. You don't need a Git Hub account to do this, but you won't be able to write your changes back to Git Hub. If you don't want to use Git at all, you can download the les in a Zip le using the button in the lower-right corner of the Git Hub page. All of the code is written to work in both Python and Python with no translation. I developed this book using Anaconda from Continuum Analytics, which is a free Python distribution that includes all the packages you'll need to run the code (and lots more). I found Anaconda easy to install. By default it does a user-level installation, not system-level, so you don't need administrative privileges. And it supports both Python and Python . You can download Anaconda from https: www.anaconda.com distribution . If you don't want to use Anaconda, you will need the following packages: . Using the code vii Num Py for basic numerical computation, http: www.numpy.org ; Sci Py for scienti c computation, http: www.scipy.org ; matplotlib for visualization, http: matplotlib.org . Although these are commonly used packages, they are not included with all Python installations, and they can be hard to install in some environments. If you have trouble installing them, I recommend using Anaconda or one of the other Python distributions that include these packages. Most exercises use Python scripts, but
