operations are legal (i.e., sensible) with that variable. Categorical nominal The first kind is the simplest, although it actually has two different names in common use: they re called bothcategoricalvariables andnominalvariables. These variables represent one of a set of predefined choices, where no choice is higher or greater than any other. An example would be afave colorvariable that holds the value of a child s favorite color: legal values are"red","blue","green"or "yellow". We know it s categorical from, among other things, the fact that there s no one right way toorderthose values. (Alphabetical, most-popular-first, and ordering according to the sequence of the rainbow are three possibilities. You might think of others.) Political affiliation would be another categorical variable. Its values (like"Democrat","Republican", and"Green") aren t in any particular order. (Although you might think of the traditional leftto-right political spectrum, that s only one dimension of political party, and perhaps not even the most important one.) Other examples include a film s genre, a student s nationality, and a football player s position. Now you might be tempted to think, hmm all the categorical examples so far are textual, not numeric. Perhaps this scales of measure thing is just another way of stating the variable type? Alas, no. For one, we ll see text variables in the next category as well. For another, even data that on its surface seems numeric can actually be categorical in disguise. Consider the uniform number of an athlete. I might be interested in asking, which uniform number had the greatest professional athletes who chose it? is a good candidate: Willie Mays, Ken Griffey Jr.,and Kobe Bryantallworethatjerseynumber.
