frame , which is a set of four vectors, one for the position and three for the orientation, and we can write B A BR,AP ( ) to describe the coordinate frame B with respect to A using a vector AP and a rotation matrix A BR. Robots usually have many such frames defined along their bodies. . Mapping from one frame to another Having introduced the concept of frames, we need the ability to map coordinates in one frame to coordinates in another frame. For example, let s consider frame B having the same orientation as frame A and sitting at location APin space. As the orientation of both frames is the same, we can express a point BQin frame A as: AQ BQ AP ( ) In reality, adding two vectors that are in different reference frames, i.e., BQ AP, is only possible if both of them have the same orientation. We can, however, convert from one reference frame to the other using the rotation matrix: AP A BRBP ( ) and therefore solve the mapping problem regardless of the orientation of A to B : AQ A BRBQ AP ( ) Using this notation, we can see that leading subscripts cancel the leading superscripts of the following vector rotation matrix. Even though we have now a solution to transform a point from one frame of reference to another by combining a rotation and a translation, it would be more appealing to write it in a more compact form, i.e.: AQ A BTBQ ( ) In order to do this, we need to introduce a position vector such that AQ A BRAP BQ ( ) .
