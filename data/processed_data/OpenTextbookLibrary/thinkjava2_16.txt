According to Larry Greenfield in The Linux Users Guide, One of Linus s earlier projects was a program that would switch between printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved to Linux. Finally, programming sometimes brings out strong emotions. If you are struggling with a difficult bug, you might feel angry, despondent, or embarrassed. Remember that you are not alone, and virtually every programmer has had similar experiences. Don t hesitate to reach out to a friend and ask questions! Chapter Computer Programming Vocabulary Throughout the book, we try to define each term the first time we use it. At the end of each chapter, we include the new terms and their definitions in order of appearance. If you spend some time learning this vocabulary, you will have an easier time reading the following chapters. problem solving:The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and expressing the solution. hardware:The electronic and mechanical components of a computer, such as CPUs, RAM, and hard disks. processor:Acomputerchipthatperformssimpleinstructionslikebasicarithmetic and logic. memory:Circuits that store data as long as the computer is turned on. Not to be confused with permanent storage devices like hard disks and flash. program:A sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform tasks on a computer. Also known as software . programming:The application of problem solving to creating executable computer programs. statement:Part of a program that specifies one step of an algorithm. print statement:A statement that causes output to be displayed on the screen. method:A named sequence of statements. class:For now, a collection of related methods.
