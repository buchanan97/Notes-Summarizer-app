not in the way the original proponents of the killer micro theory envisioned. Instead, the microprocessor performance has relentlessly gained on the supercomputer performance. This has occurred for two reasons. First, there was much more technology headroom for improving performance in the personal computer area, whereas the supercomputers of the late 1980s were pushing the performance envelope. Also, once the supercomputer companies broke through some technical barrier , the microprocessor companies could quickly adopt the successful elements of the supercomputer designs a few short years later . The second and perhaps more important factor was the emer gence of a thriving personal and business computer market with ever - increasing performance demands. Computer usage such as D graphics, graphical user interfaces, multimedia, and games were the driving factors in this market. W ith such a lar ge market, available research dollars poured into developing inexpensive high performance processors for the home market. The result of this trend toward faster smaller computers is directly evident as former supercomputer manufacturers are being purchased by workstation companies (Silicon Graphics purchased Cray , and Hewlett-Packard purchased Convex in 1996). As a result nearly every person with computer access has some high performance processing. As the peak speeds of these new personal computers increase, these computers encounter all the performance challenges typically found on supercomputers. While not all users of personal workstations need to know the intimate details of high performance computing, those who program these systems for maximum performance will benefit from an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these newest high performance systems. Scope of High Performance Computing High performance computing runs a broad range of systems, from our desktop computers through
