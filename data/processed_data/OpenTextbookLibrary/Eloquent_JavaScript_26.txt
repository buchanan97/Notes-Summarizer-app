Man, that stuff wil l kick the peaches right out your gil ls! why, Why s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby Chapter2 Program Structure In this chapter, we will start to do things that can actually be called programming. We will expand our command of the Java Script language beyond the nouns and sentence fragments we ve seen so far to the point where we can express meaningful prose. Expressionsandstatements In Chapter , we made values and applied operators to them to get new values. Creating values like this is the main substance of any Java Script program. But that substance has to be framed in a larger structure to be useful. That s what we ll cover in this chapter. A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression . Every value that is written literally (such as 22or"psychoanalysis" ) is an expression. An expression between parentheses is also an expression, as is a binary operator applied to two expressions or a unary operator applied to one. This shows part of the beauty of a language-based interface. Expressions can contain other expressions in a way similar to how subsentences in human languages are nested a subsentence can contain its own subsentences, and so on. This allows us to build expressions that describe arbitrarily complex computations. If an expression corresponds to a sentence fragment, a Java Script statement corresponds to a full sentence.
