show the same curve to middle school students, they may proudly say that this must be the right half of a attened parabola that they just learned about last week. And there is nothing fundamentally wrong with that idea. It could be a right half of a parabola, indeed. We never know for sure until we see what the entire curve looks like for t . Let s move on to a more dif cult example. Create a mathematical model of the following observation. Time Some quantity Figure : Observation example . It is getting harder. Unless you have seen this kind of dynamic behavior before, you will have a hard time coming up with any concise explanation of it. An engineer might say, This is a sawtooth wave, or a computer scientist might say, This is time mod something. Or, an even more brilliant answer could come from an elementary school kid, saying, This must be months in a calendar! (which is equivalent to what the computer scientist said, by the way). In either case, people tend to map a new observation to something they already know in their mind when they create a model. CHAPTER . FUNDAMENTALS OF MODELING This last example is the toughest. Create a mathematical model of the following observation. Time Some quantity Figure : Observation example . Did you come up with any ideas? I have seen only a few people who were able to make reasonable models of this observation throughout my career. The reason why this example is so hard to model is because we don t see this kind of behavior often in our lives. We are simply not experienced with
