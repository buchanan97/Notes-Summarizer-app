nearly everything can be assigned a geographic location. Once we know the location of something, we can a put it on a map, for example, with a GIS. Generally, we tend to define and describe locations in nominal or absolute terms. In the case of the former, locations are simply defined and described by name. For example, city names such as New York, Tokyo, or London refer to nominal locations. Toponymy, or the study of place names and their respective history and meanings, is concerned with such nominal locations (Monmonier 1996, 2006). , Though we tend to associate the notion of location with particular points on the surface of the earth, locations can also refer to geographic features (e.g., Rocky Mountains) or large areas (e.g., Siberia). The United States Board on Geographic Names ( http: geonames.usgs.gov ) maintains geographic naming standards and keeps track of such names through the Geographic Names Information Systems (GNIS; http: geonames.usgs.gov pls gn ispublic ). The GNIS database also provides information about which state and county the feature is located as well as its geographic coordinates.

For instance, defining a location on the surface of the earth using latitude and longitude is an example of absolute location. Postal codes and street addresses are other examples of absolute location that usually follow some form of local logic. Though there is no global standard when it comes to street addresses, we can determine the geographic coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) of particular street addresses, zip codes, place names, and
