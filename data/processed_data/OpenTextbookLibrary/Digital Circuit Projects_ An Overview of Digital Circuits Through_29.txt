K - map, and how to solve a K -map with don't care conditions. Gray Codes Gray codes are simply binary codes where the numbers adjacent numbers differ by a single digit. A single digit number only has a single digit, so it is trivial. Now consider the Gray Code for a two digit number s. It would be: Table - : -digit Gray Codes In this Gray Code, each number differs from its neighbor by digit. - - - - (note that the Gray code is circular or wraps around from the bottom to the top). A digit Gray Code can be created by reflecting (like a mirror) the digit Gray Code through a plane, and prepending a to the numbers at the top of the table, and a to the numbers at the bottom of the table. DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS Table - : -digit Gray Codes Once again that all values in this table differ from the adjacent values by digit, but in addition the table has been group into collections of - bit groupings. For example, the rows and both contain 00x, rows and contain 0x1, rows and contain 10x, rows and contain x10, etc (where x is , ). Note that once again the table wraps, so rows and both contain x00. Gray Codes are useful in partitioning a space to group like elements together, and this property will be used in the next section on K -maps. -Variable Karnaugh Maps A Karnaugh map (or simply K -map) is a mapping of a truth table that partitions the truth table so that elements that have the same values are placed adjacent to each other.
