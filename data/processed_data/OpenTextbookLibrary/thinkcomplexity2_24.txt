next section we will generate ER graphs and check whether they are connected. Generating ER graphs The ER graph G(n;p) containsnnodes, and each pair of nodes is connected by an edge with probability p. Generating an ER graph is similar to generating a complete graph. The following generator function enumerates all possible edges and chooses which ones should be added to the graph: def random pairs(nodes, p): for edge in all pairs(nodes): if flip(p): yield edge random pairs uses flip : Generating ER graphs Figure : An ER graph with n andp . def flip(p): return np.random.random() p This is the rst example we're seen that uses Num Py. Following convention, I import numpy asnp. Num Py provides a module named random , which provides a method named random , which returns a number between and , uniformly distributed. Soflip returns True with the given probability, p, and False with the complementary probability, -p. Finally, make random graph generates and returns the ER graph G(n;p): def make random graph(n, p): G nx.Graph() nodes range(n) G.add nodes from(nodes) G.add edges from(random pairs(nodes, p)) return G make random graph is almost identical to make complete graph ; the only di erence is that it uses random pairs instead of all pairs . Here's an example with p : random graph make random graph( , ) Chapter Graphs Prob of edge (p) Prob connected Figure : Probability of connectivity with n and a range of p. The vertical line shows the predicted critical value. Figure shows the result. This graph turns out to be connected; in fact, most ER graphs with n andp : are connected. In the next section, we'll see how
