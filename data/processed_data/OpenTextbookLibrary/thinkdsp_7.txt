of the period. The units of frequency are cycles per second, or Hertz , abbreviated Hz". (Strictly speaking, the number of cycles is a dimensionless number, so a Hertz is really a per second"). The frequency of this signal is about Hz, slightly lower than Hz, which is the standard tuning pitch for orchestral music. The musical name of this note is A, or more speci cally, A4. If you are not familiar with scienti c pitch notation", the numerical su x indicates which octave the note is in. A4 is the A above middle C. A5 is one octave higher. See http: en.wikipedia.org wiki Scientific pitch notation . A tuning fork generates a sinusoid because the vibration of the tines is a form of simple harmonic motion. Most musical instruments produce periodic signals, but the shape of these signals is not sinusoidal. For example, Figure shows . Spectral decomposition Time (s) Figure : Segment from a recording of a violin. a segment from a recording of a violin playing Boccherini's String Quintet No. in E, 3rd movement. Again we can see that the signal is periodic, but the shape of the signal is more complex. The shape of a periodic signal is called the waveform . Most musical instruments produce waveforms more complex than a sinusoid. The shape of the waveform determines the musical timbre , which is our perception of the quality of the sound. People usually perceive complex waveforms as rich, warm and more interesting than sinusoids. Spectral decomposition The most important topic in this book is spectral decomposition , which is the idea that any signal can be expressed as the sum of sinusoids with di
