that does all the interrupt handling , handles communication with the user and with hardware devices, and controls which threa d is allowed to run is called theoperating system . The operating system is the basic, essential software with out which a computer would not be able to function. Other programs, suc h as word processors and Web browsers, are dependent upon the operating system. Comm on desktop operating systems include Linux, various versions of Windows, and Mac OS. Oper ating systems for smartphones and tablets include Android and i OS. CHAPTER . THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE The Java Virtual Machine Machine language consists of very simple instructions that can be executed directly by the CPU of a computer. Almost all programs, though, are writt en inhigh-level programming languages such as Java, Python, or C . A program written in a high-leve l language cannot be run directly on any computer. First, it has to be translate d into machine language. This translationcanbedonebyaprogramcalleda compiler . Acompilertakesahigh-level-language program and translates it into an executable machine-langu age program. Once the translation is done, the machine-language program can be run any number o f times, but of course it can only be run on one type of computer, since each type of compute r has its own individual machine language. (In fact, Java also depends on the particu lar operating system under which it is running, since it must work with the operating system to perform certain tasks such as accessing the computer s hardware. But let s ignore that co mplication here.) If the program is to run on another type of computer it has to be re-translated, using a di erent compiler,
