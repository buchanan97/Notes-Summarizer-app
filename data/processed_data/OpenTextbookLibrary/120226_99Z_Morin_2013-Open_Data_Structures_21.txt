Then E Ii ( ) ( ) : Now,X Pk i Ii, so E X E2 666664k X i Ii3 777775 k X i E Ii k X i k : This is a bit more long-winded, but doesn t require that we know any magical identities or compute any non-trivial probabilities. Even better, it agrees with the intuition that we expect half the coins to turn up as heads precisely because each individual coin turns up as heads with a probability of . The Model of Computation In this book, we will analyze the theoretical running times of operations on the data structures we study. To do this precisely, we need a mathematical model of computation. For this, we use the w-bit word-RAM model. Correctness, Time Complexity, and Space Complexity RAM stands for Random Access Machine. In this model, we have access to a random access memory consisting of cells, each of which stores a wbitword . This implies that a memory cell can represent, for example, any integer in the set f0;:::;2w 1g. In the word-RAM model, basic operations on words take constant time. This includes arithmetic operations ( , , , , ), comparisons ( , , , , ), and bitwise boolean operations (bitwise-AND, OR, and exclusive-OR). Any cell can be read or written in constant time. A computer s memory is managed by a memory management system from which we can allocate or deallocate a block of memory of any size we would like. Allocating a block of memory of size ktakes O(k) time and returns
