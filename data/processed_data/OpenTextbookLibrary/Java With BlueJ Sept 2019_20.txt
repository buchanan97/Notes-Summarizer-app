that calculates this amount to be returned to t he customer. Use variables amount Charged, amount Given, amount Returned to represent the different amounts. Test your program with amount Charged and amount Given . . Write a program that uses the formula where c represents degrees Celsius to calculate the equivalent Fahrenheit value. Test your program using c . . Write a program that uses the formula where f represents degrees Fahrenheit to calculate the equivalent Celsius value. Test your program using f . . Write a program that uses the formula to calculate the area of a triangle. Run your program for h . boolean Data Type The boolean type has two values: true and false . We will see that the boolean type can be useful when we discuss control structures in the next chapter. There are three operators defined for booleans: and, or and not represented in Java as , , and ! respectively. and are binary operators where the operator appears between the two operands; ! is a unary operator that precedes its operand. Bool ean operators operator in Java meaning AND Evaluates to true if and only if both operands are true; evaluates to false otherwise. OR Evaluates to true if at least one operand is true; evaluates to false if both operands are false. NOT ! NOT: nega tes the operand. Three truth tables below show the results for Boolean operators for all possible values of their operands. Boolean operation of AND Boolean operation of OR Boolean operation of NOT a b a b a b a b a ! a true true true true true true true false false true false false true
