and the rows with the varieties (or vice versa, it doesn t matter). Small Medium Large Latte small latte medium latte large latte Mocha small mocha medium mocha large mocha Espresso small espresso medium espresso large espresso Cappuccino small cappuccino medium cappuccino large cappuccino As you can see, a different combination of variety and size appears in each entry of the table, and every possible combination of variety and size appears somewhere. Thus the total number of possible choices is the number of entries in this table. Although in a small example like this we could simply count all of the entries and see that there are twelve, it will be more useful to notice that elementary arithmetic tells us that the number of entries in the table will be the number of rows times the number of columns, which is four times three. . Basic Counting Techniques In other words, to determine the total number of choices you have, we multiply the number of choices of variety (that is, the number of rows in our table) by the number of choices of size (that is, the number of columns in our table). This is an example of what we ll call the product rule. We re now ready to state the product rule in its full generality. THEOREM (Product Rule). Suppose that when you are determining the total number of outcomes, you can identify two different aspects that can vary. If there are n1possible outcomes for the first aspect, and for each of those possible outcomes, there are n2possible outcomes for the second aspect, then the total number of possible outcomes wil l be n1n2. In the above example,
