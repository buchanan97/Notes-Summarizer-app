The realization that there is much to programming "beyond notation" (i.e. principles that transcend any one language) is a big step forward in a programmer's development. Part II aims to help the reader take this step forward. We present examples that are best understood by focusing on abstract principles of algorithm design, and only later do we grope for suitable notations to turn this principle into an algorithm expressed in sufficient detail to become executable. In keeping with our predilection for graphic communication, the first informal expression of an algorithmic idea is often pictorial. We show by example how such representations, although they may be incomplete, can be turned into programs in a formal notation. The literature on programming and languages. There are many books that present principles of programming and of programming languages from a higher level of abstraction. The principles highlighted differ from author to author, ranging from intuitive understanding to complete formality. The following textbooks provide an excellent sample from the broad spectrum of approaches: ASS , ASU , Ben , Ben , Ben , Dij , DF , Gri , and Mey .
