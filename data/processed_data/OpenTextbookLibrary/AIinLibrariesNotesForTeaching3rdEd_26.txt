because it is known, for most of the cases, what the correct answers are. A Machine Learner could, alternatively, be challenged to classify marks (characters) on paper into groups of marks (characters) similar to other characters i.e. clustering (forming clusters of similar characters). That would be unsupervised learning, where there are no known right or wrong answers (and no teacher). A first issue here is that there is no ML constraint as to how many clusters there might be, or should be, in any given problem. For example, the music streamer Spotify plays songs that the listener wishes to listen to; Spotify can cluster these songs into similar songs and perhaps mark those as being playlists or radio stations ; then the User can listen to a radio station while cooking, or while going for a walk etc. But the clustering algorithm needs to know how many radio stations should there be: stations, stations, ? There is no answer to that question from within the ML system. Spotify itself, or the User, or some outside party, has to decide on the number of stations. Going back to OCR and attempting to do it in an unsupervised fashion. We could help it by saying we would like clusters (we have in mind here one for each letter of the alphabet, and for each digit). Clustering might then lead to mistakes like characters that we consider to be upper case I s being put together with lower case l s or zeros with upper case O s. There is no training set. There are no right or wrong answers available to assess the program. Unsupervised classification might be perfect in certain areas,
