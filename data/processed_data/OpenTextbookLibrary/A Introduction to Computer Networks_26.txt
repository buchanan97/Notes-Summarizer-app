Consider, for a moment, the following network: Should S1 list S2 or S3 as the next hop to B? Both paths A S1 S2 S4 B and A S1 S3 S4 B get there. There is no right answer. Even if one path is faster than the other, taking the slower path is not exactly wrong (especially if the slower path is, say, less expensive). Some sort of protocol must exist to provide a mechanism by which S1 can make the choice (though this mechanism might be as simple as choosing to An Overview of Networks An Introduction to Computer Networks, Release S1 S2 S3 S4 BA Fig. :: A network with more than one path from A to B route via the rst path discovered to the given destination). We also want protocols to make sure that, if S1 reaches B via S2 and the S2 S4 link fails, then S1 will switch over to the still-working S1 S3 S4 B route. As we shall see, many LANs (in particular Ethernet) prefer tree networks with no redundancy, while IP has complex protocols in support of redundancy ( Routing-Update Algorithms ). Traf c Engineering In some cases the decision above between routes A S1 S2 S4 B and A S1 S3 S4 B might be of material signi cance perhaps the S2 S4 link is slower than the others, or is more congested. We will use the term traf c engineering to refer to any intentional selection of one route over another, or any elevation of the priority of one class of traf c. The route selection can either be directly intentional, through con guration, or can be implicit in
