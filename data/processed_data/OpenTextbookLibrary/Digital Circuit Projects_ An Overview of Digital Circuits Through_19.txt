speed CMOS, ttl compatible sss: The type of chip. For example: o 7408 is a quad - input AND gate chip o 7432 is a quad - input OR gate chip n: Indicates the packaging of the chip. Only type n is used in this text. For most of the 7400 series chips below, ttl, HC, and HCT chips can be considered interchangeable in the circuits in this text1. So for a 7408 quad - input AND gate chip, the following chips would all be valid: 7408 N, HC08 N, HCT08 N However the following chips could not be used: 7408 D - Any chip designated D is a surface mounted chip, and will not work with the breadboard. Other types of packaging might be encountered, and should be assumed not to be compatible. LS08 N - There are numerous technologies used to implemen t 7400 components. For this text, only ttl, HC, and HCT types of chips are recommended. Some type of chips (ACT, BCT, FCT, etc) would probably work, and others (LS, ALVC, etc) will definitely not work. For readers interested in a more detailed discussion of the chip technology, please refer to the Wikipedia page referenced above. To simplify the process of obtaining the correct chips, a web site is maintained at www.chuckkann.com books Digital Circuits kits.html. It lists a number of retailers who sell these chips, and the retailers part numbers for each chip. A complete list of follows. 7805 V voltage regulator 7400 quad - input NAND gate 7402 quad - input NOR gate 7404 hex Inverter ( NOT gate) 7408 quad - input AND gate 7414 hex Schmitt Trigger Inverter (NOT gate) 7432 quad
