used t o adjust the size, orientation, and position of a geometric object. When making a model of an auto mobile, we build onewheel. We then apply four di erent transforms to the wheel model to a dd four copies of the wheel to the automobile. Similarly, we can add several automobile s to a scene by applying di erent transforms to the same automobile model. The three most basic kinds of geometric transform are called scaling,rotation , and translation . A scaling transform is used to set the size of an object, that is, to make it bigger or smaller by some speci ed factor. A rotation transf orm is used to set an object s orientation, by rotating it by some angle about some speci c axis. A translation transform is used to set the position of an object, by displacing it by a g iven amount from its original position. In this book, we will meet these transformations rst in two dimensions, where they are easier to understand. But it is in D graphics that they be come truly essential. Next, appearance Geometric shapes by themselves are not very interesting. Yo u have to be able to set their appearance. This is done by assign ing attributes to the geometric objects. An obvious attribute is color, but getting a realis tic appearance turns out to be a lot more complicated than simply specifying a color for each pri mitive. In D graphics, instead of CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION color, we usually talk about material . The term material here refers to the properties that determine the intrinsic visual appearance of a surface. Ess entially, this means how the
