Python . Some of the changes are: I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter. These sections present general techniques for nding and avoiding bugs, and warnings about Python pitfalls. I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of understanding to a few substantial projects. Most exercises include a link to my solution. I added a series of case studies longer examples with exercises, solutions, and discussion. I expanded the discussion of program development plans and basic design patterns. I added appendices about debugging and analysis of algorithms. The second edition of Think Python has these new features: The book and all supporting code have been updated to Python . I added a few sections, and more details on the web, to help beginners get started running Python in a browser, so you don t have to deal with installing Python until you want to. For Chapter I switched from my own turtle graphics package, called Swampy, to a more standard Python module, turtle , which is easier to install and more powerful. I added a new chapter called The Goodies , which introduces some additional Python features that are not strictly necessary, but sometimes handy. I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think like a computer scientist, at least a little bit. Allen B. Downey Olin College Acknowledgments Many thanks to Jeff Elkner, who translated my Java book into Python, which got this project started and introduced me to what has turned out to be my favorite language. Thanks also to Chris Meyers, who contributed several sections to How to Think Like a Computer Scientist
