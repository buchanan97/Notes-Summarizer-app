y. Return true ifxwas added to the set and false otherwise. .remove (x): remove xfrom the set; Find an element yin the set such that xequals yand remove y. Return y, ornull if no such element exists. .find (x): nd xin the set if it exists; Find an element yin the set such that yequals x. Return y, ornull if no such element exists. These de nitions are a bit fussy about distinguishing x, the element we are removing or nding, from y, the element we may remove or nd. This is because xandymight actually be distinct objects that are nevertheless treated as equal. Such a distinction is useful because it allows for the creation of dictionaries ormaps that map keys onto values. To create a dictionary map, one forms compound objects called Pair s, each of which contains a keyand a value . Two Pair s are treated as equal if their keys are equal. If we store some pair ( k;v) in a USet and then later call the find (x) method using the pair x (k;null ) the result will be y (k;v). In other words, it is possible to recover the value, v, given only the key, k. In Java, this is done by overriding the class s equals (y) and hash Code () methods. Mathematical Background The SSet Interface: Sorted Sets The SSet interface represents a sorted set of elements. An SSet stores elements from some total order, so that any two elements xand ycan be compared. In code examples, this will be done with a method called compare (x;y) in which compare (x;y) : if x y if x y if x y An
