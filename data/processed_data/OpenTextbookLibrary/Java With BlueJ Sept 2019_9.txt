later in a program to assign a value, to alter the current value , and to reference the value currently stored. Two example programs follow; in Listing the program defines and uses a variable, and in Listing the program alters the value stored in a variable. In Listing note the following: In line an int variable named i is declared, In line the value is assigned to i (that is, the value is stored in the memory location reserved for i), Line displays th e value of i Listing : Using a variable This Java class declares an int va riable named i, assigns the value to i, and displays i. public class Variable public static void main(String args) int i; i ; System.out.println(i); Listing starts off like L isting but modifies the value of i to in line just before it is displayed for the second time. This program changes the value associated with the variable. Listing : Changing the value stored in a variable This Java class declares an int variable named i, assigns it a value and then changes its value. public class Variable Changed public static void main(String args) int i; i ; System.out.println(i); i ; System.out.println(i); Naming Variables A convention used by many Java programmers is to choose names that are concise yet meaningful. A name you choose should indicate the intent of its use. In situations where the intent of use involves more than one word a common naming scheme is camel case . For instance, suppose you need a variable to keep track of net pay. In order to have a proper name a programmer could choose the name net Pay for the
