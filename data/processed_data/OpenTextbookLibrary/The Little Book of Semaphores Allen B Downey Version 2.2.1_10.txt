thread, we can always tell what order things happen. We can denote the order of events a1 a2 a3 a4 b1 b2 b3 where the relation a1 a2 means that a1 happened before a2. In general, though, there is no way to compare events from di erent threads; for example, we have no idea who ate breakfast rst (is a1 b1?). But with message passing (the phone call) we cantell who ate lunch rst (a3 b3). Assuming that Bob has no other friends, he won t get a call until you call, so b2 a4 . Combining all the relations, we get b3 b2 a4 a3 which proves that you had lunch before Bob. Inthiscase, wewouldsaythatyouand Bobatelunch sequentially , because we know the order of events, and you ate breakfast concurrently , because we don t.

As a shorthand, that s ne, as long as you remember the strict de nition: Twoeventsareconcurrentifwecannottellbylookingatthep rogram which will happen rst. Sometimes we can tell, after the program runs, which happene d rst, but often not, and even if we can, there is no guarantee that we wil l get the same result the next time. Introduction Non-determinism Concurrent programs are often non-deterministic , which means it is not possible to tell, by looking at the program, what will happen whe n it executes. Here is a simple example of a non-deterministic program: Thread A 1print "yes"Thread B 1print "no" Because the two threads run concurrently, the order of execu tion depends on the scheduler. During any given run of this program, the ou tput might be yes no or no yes . Non-determinism is one
