to as odometry . Roboticists are often concerned with trying to compute the inverse relationship: the position each joint must be at for the end-effector to be in a desired position or pose. This is generally a far more complex, underdetermined problem, known as inverse kinematics . As we will see below, kinematics is the simplest and most fundamental level of abstraction that a roboticist can use to model the motion of a robot and its geometry: it deals exclusively with positional quantities, and considers the robot as if it was frozen in time. Although this simplification is far from being realistic, we will see that a lot can be done through kinematics alone! However, a more expressive tool at our disposal is to do a similar modeling in a second level of abstraction that operates in velocity space; this domain is called differential kinematics and is introduced in Section . In all, the goals of this chapter are to: . Kinematics Introduce the forward kinematics of simple arms and mobile robots, and understand the concept of holono
