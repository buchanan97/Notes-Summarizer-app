We can declare and initialize as: int days In Month , , , , , , , , , , , ; The Java syntax for initializing an array is to enclose a comma-separated list of values between the pair . Initializing arrays this way also sets the length of the array. The value of days In Month.length is . Example Array initialization and displaying each element Consider the following program where days In Month is initialized and displayed. Listing : Initializing and displaying an array. Display number of days in each month 4public class Month Lengths public static void main ( String args ) int days In Month , , , , , , , , , , , ; System .out . println (" Days for each of " days In Month . length " months "); for (int i ; i days In Month . length ; i ) System .out . print ( days In Month i " "); The output: CHAPTER . ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS Storage of arrays and copying arrays Arrays are objects in Java and so the memory location for the array variable contains a reference to the actual storage locations holding the array's values. For instance the memory allocations for an array can be visualized as: Now suppose we need to make a copy of the array. If we just use: s t; s and t are arrays of same type what we end up with is two storage locations for sand tthat reference the same elements. We haven't created a copy, rather we have two array variables that reference the same elements: If we need a real copy of the array tthen
