of bytes that are transported inside one or more packets. A transport layer entity issues segments (or sometimes part of segments) as Data.request to the underlying network layer entity. There are different types of transport layers. The most widely used transport layers on the Internet are TCP ,that provides a reliable connection-oriented bytestream transport service, and UDP ,that provides an unreliable connection-less transport service. Physical layer Datalink Network Physical layer Datalink Network Transport Physical layer Datalink Network Transport Segments Figure : The transport layer The upper layer of our architecture is the Application layer. This layer includes all the mechanisms and data structures that are necessary for the applications. We will use Application Data Unit (ADU) to indicate the data exchanged between two entities of the Application layer.

RFC 1122 , which de nes the requirements for Internet hosts, mentions four different layers. Starting from the top, these are : an Application layer a Transport layer an Internet layer which is equivalent to the network layer of our reference model a Link layer which combines the functionalities of the physical and datalink layers of our ve-layer reference model Besides this difference in the lower layers, the TCP IP reference model is very close to the ve layers that we use throughout this document.
