topics that give beginners trouble into a series of small steps, so that they can exercise each new concept in isolation before continuing. Balance of Java and concepts:The book is not primarily about Java; it uses code examples to demonstrate computer science. Most chapters start with language features and end with concepts. viii PREFACE Conciseness:An important goal of the book is to be small enough so that students can read and understand the entire text in a one-semester college or AP course. Emphasis on vocabulary:We try to introduce the minimum number of terms and define them carefully when they are first used. We also organize them in glossaries at the end of each chapter. Program development:There are many strategies for writing programs, including bottom-up, top-down, and others. We demonstrate multiple program development techniques, allowing readers to choose methods that work best for them. Multiple learning curves:To write a program, you have to understand the algorithm, knowtheprogramminglanguage, andbeabletodebugerrors. We discuss these and other aspects throughout the book and summarize our advice in Appendix??. Object-Oriented Programming Some Java books introduce classes and objects immediately; others begin with procedural programming and transition to object-oriented more gradually. Many of Java s object-oriented features are motivated by problems with previous languages, and their implementations are influenced by this history. Some of these features are hard to explain when people aren t familiar with the problems they solve. We get to object-oriented programming as quickly as possible (beginning with Chapter??). But we introduce concepts one at a time, as clearly as possible, in a way that allows readers to practice each idea in isolation before moving on. So it takes some time to get there. Youcan
