OO concepts, instructors can use some of Java s basic features the class library, Swing and GUI components to motivate these discussions in a natural way. Organization of the Text The book is still organized into three main parts. Part I (Chapters - ) introduces the basic concepts of object orientation and the basic features of the Java language. Part II (Chapters - ) focuses on remaining language elements, including data types, control structures, string and array processing, and inheritance and polymorphism. Part III (Chapters - ) covers advanced topics, including exceptions, le I O, recursion, GUIs, threads and concurrent programming, sockets and networking, data structures, servlets, and Java Server Pages. The rst two parts make up the topics that are typically covered in an introductory CS1 course. The chapters in Part III are self-contained and can be selectively added to the end of a CS1 course if time permits. The rst part (Chapters through ) introduces the basic concepts of object orientation, including objects, classes, methods, parameter passing, information hiding, and a little taste of inheritance, and polymorphism. The primary focus in these chapters is on introducing the basic idea that an object-oriented program is a collection of objects that communicate and cooperate with each other to solve problems. Java language elements are introduced as needed to reinforce this idea. Students are given the basic building blocks for constructing Java programs from scratch. Although the programs in the rst few chapters have limited functionality in terms of control structures and data types, the priority is placed vii Table : A one-semester course.
