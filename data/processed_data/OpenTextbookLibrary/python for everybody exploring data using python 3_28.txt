the material. Look forwar ds and backwards and read with a light touch. By skimming more advanced materia l without fully understanding the details, you can get a better understanding of the why? of programming. By reviewing previous material and even redoing earlier exercises, you will realize that you actually learned a lot of material even if the material you are currently staring at seems a bit impenetrable. Usually when you are learning your rst programming language, there are a few wonderful Ah Hah! moments where you can look up from pounding away at some rock with a hammer and chisel and step away and see that you are indeed building a beautiful sculpture. If something seems particularly hard, there is usually no value in staying up all night and staring at it. Take a break, take a nap, have a snack, explain what y ou are having a problem with to someone (or perhaps your dog), and then come back to it with fresh eyes. I assure you that once you learn the programming concepts in the book you will look back and see that it was all really easy and elegan t and it simply took you a bit of time to absorb it.
