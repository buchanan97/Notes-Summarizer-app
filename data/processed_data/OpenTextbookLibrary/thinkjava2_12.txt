first line System.out.println("How are you?"); another line As this example also shows, you can put comments at the end of a line as well as on lines all by themselves. Phrases that appear in quotation marks are calledstrings, because they contain a sequence of characters strung together in memory. Characters can be letters, numbers, punctuation marks, symbols, spaces, tabs, etc. System.out.printlnappends a special character, called anewline, that moves to the beginning of the next line. If you don t want a newline at the end, you can useprintinstead ofprintln: public class Goodbye public static void main(String args) System.out.print("Goodbye, "); System.out.println("cruel world"); In this example, the first statement does not add a newline, so the output appears on a single line: Goodbye, cruel world Notice that there is a space at the end of the first string, which appears in the output just before the wordcruel. Formatting Source Code In Java source code, some spaces are required. For example, you need at least one space between words, so this program is not legal: Chapter Computer Programming publicclass Goodbye publicstaticvoidmain(String args) System.out.print("Goodbye, "); System.out.println("cruel world"); But most other spaces are optional. For example, this programislegal: public class Goodbye public static void main(String args) System.out.print("Goodbye, "); System.out.println("cruel world"); The newlines are optional, too. So we could just write this: public class Goodbye public static void main(String args) System.out.print("Goodbye, "); System.out.println ("cruel world"); It still works, but the program is getting harder and harder to read. Newlines andspacesareimportantforvisuallyorganizingyourprogram,makingiteasier to understand the program and find errors when they occur. Many editors will automatically format source code with consistent indenting and line breaks. For example, in Dr Java (see Appendix??) you can indent your code by
