course materials of my own, I carried with me an acute aware - ness of several things. First, the volume of free, online reference materials including video tutorials, community groups, and books (now including this text) is so far greater than what a single printed volume could handle, that the idea of creating a comprehensive source seemed laughably redundant. Second, many of the texts that march across my desk for review each semester focus primarily on the underpinnings of a particular language, while spending little time introducing or reinforcing the methodology and general practice of the language in question. While this allows those authors to delve deeper into limited topics, I have found that focusing on how languages relate and intertwine is often more beneficial, especially when just beginning to study web development. Studying languages independent of one another does little to prepare a programmer for complex systems involving multiple languages. This text is meant to reduce the confusion brought about by integrating multiple languages into one site while at the same time providing an overview of the entire devel - opment process. Within, you will find information on a variety of topics involved in the overall process of planning, designing, and finally creating a website; this background will help you understand how these pieces fit together, so you are better able to understand and contribute to a project and work with others on your team. As this is an introductory level text, the goal is not to exhaust the covered topics. Instead we will focus on familiarizing ourselves with each language s abilities and how to fuse those languages and methods together to create a responsive, well-developed site. You
