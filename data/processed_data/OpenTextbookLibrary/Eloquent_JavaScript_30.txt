Java Script, which also can t be used as binding names. The full list of keywords and reserved words is rather long: break case catch class const continue debugger default delete do else enum export extends false finally for function if implements import interface in instanceof let new package private protected public return static super switch this throw true try typeof var void while with yield Don t worry about memorizing this list. When creating a binding produces an unexpected syntax error, check whether you re trying to define a reserved word. Theenvironment The collection of bindings and their values that exist at a given time is called the environment . When a program starts up, this environment is not empty. It alwayscontainsbindingsthatarepartofthelanguagestandard,andmostofthe time, it also has bindings that provide ways to interact with the surrounding system. For example, in a browser, there are functions to interact with the currently loaded website and to read mouse and keyboard input. Functions A lot of the values provided in the default environment have the type function. A function is a piece of program wrapped in a value. Such values can be applied in order to run the wrapped program. For example, in a browser environment, the binding promptholds a function that shows a little dialog asking for user input. It is used like this: prompt("Enter passcode"); Executing a function is called invoking,cal ling, or applying it. You can call a function by putting parentheses after an expression that produces a function value. Usually you ll directly use the name of the binding that holds the function. The values between the parentheses are given to the program inside the function. In the example,
