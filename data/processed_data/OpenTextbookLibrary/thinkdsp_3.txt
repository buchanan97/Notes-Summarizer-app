some also use Jupyter notebooks. If you have not used Jupyter before, you can read about it at http: jupyter.org . There are three ways you can work with the Jupyter notebooks: Run Jupyter on your computer If you installed Anaconda, you probably got Jupyter by default. To check, start the server from the command line, like this: jupyter notebook If it's not installed, you can install it in Anaconda like this: conda install jupyter When you start the server, it should launch your default web browser or create a new tab in an open browser window. Run Jupyter on Binder Binder is a service that runs Jupyter in a virtual machine. If you follow this link, http: mybinder.org repo Allen Downey Think DSP , you should get a Jupyter home page with the notebooks for this book and the supporting data and scripts. You can run the scripts and modify them to run your own code, but the virtual machine you run in is temporary. Any changes you make will disappear, along with the virtual machine, if you leave it idle for more than about an hour. View notebooks on nbviewer When we refer to notebooks later in the book, we will provide links to nbviewer, which provides a static view of the code and results. You can use these links to read the notebooks and listen to the examples, but you won't be able to modify or run the code, or use the interactive widgets. Good luck, and have fun! viii Chapter .
