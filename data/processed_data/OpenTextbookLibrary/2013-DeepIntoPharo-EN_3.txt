present a new dialect of Smalltalk called Pharo that has been speci cally designed for inventive developers. The authors are key members of the Pharo team and accomplished Object Oriented educators, researchers and designers. Numerous Smalltalk projects from the authors and others have been ported to Pharo. Enjoy Deep Into Pharo - Dave Thomas1 Using a programming language is so far the most convenient way for a human to tell a computer what it should do. Pharo is an object-oriented programming language, highly in uenced by Smalltalk. Pharo is more than a syntax and a bunch of semantics rules as most programming languages are. Pharo comes with an extensible and exible programming environment. Thanks to its numerous object-oriented libraries and frameworks, Pharo shines for modeling and visualizing data, scripting, networking and many other ranges of applications. The very light syntax and the malleable object model of Pharo are commonly praised. Both early learners and experienced programmers enjoy the everything is an object paradigm. The simplicity and expressiveness of Pharo as well as a living environment empowers programmers with a wonderful and unique experience. Deep into Pharo is the second volume of a book series initiated with Pharo by Example2. Deep into Pharo, the book you are reading, accompa1 David ( http: www.davethomas.net ) is a well-known gure in modern software development and object technology. Thomas is perhaps best known as the founder and past CEO of Object Technology International, Inc., now IBM OTI Labs.
