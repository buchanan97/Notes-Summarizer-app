this would happen, since O(n) O(nlogn). In a few cases, we will use asymptotic notation on functions with more than one variable. There seems to be no standard for this, but for our purposes, the following de nition is su cient: O(f(n1;:::;nk)) :g(n1;:::;nk) : there exists c , andzsuch that g(n1;:::;nk) c f(n1;:::;nk) for alln1;:::;nksuch thatg(n1;:::;nk) z9 ;: This de nition captures the situation we really care about: when the argumentsn1;:::;nkmakegtake on large values. This de nition also agrees with the univariate de nition of O(f(n)) whenf(n) is an increasing function ofn. The reader should be warned that, although this works for our purposes, other texts may treat multivariate functions and asymptotic notation di erently. Randomization and Probability Some of the data structures presented in this book are randomized ; they make random choices that are independent of the data being stored in them or the operations being performed on them. For this reason, performing the same set of operations more than once using these structures could result in di erent running times. When analyzing these data struc15 Introduction 02004006008001000120014001600 100f(n) n15n 2nlogn 050000100000150000200000250000300000 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000f(n) n15n 2nlogn Figure : Plots of nversus nlogn. Mathematical Background tures we are interested in their average or expected running times. Formally, the running time of an operation on a randomized data structure is a random variable, and we want to study its expected value . For a discrete random variable Xtaking on values in some countable universe U, the expected value of X, denoted by E X , is given by the formula E X X x2 Ux Prf X xg: Here Prf Egdenotes the
