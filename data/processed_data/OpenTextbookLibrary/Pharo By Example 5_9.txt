Hub ( http: www.smalltalkhub.com ) is the equivalent of Source Forge Github for Pharo projects. Many extra packages and projects for Pharo live there. Pharo is also active on Slack - a platform for chat based on IRC ( http: pharoproject.slack.com ), just ask for an invitation on Pharo s websitehttp: pharo.org community , in the slack section. Everybody is welcomed. Examples and exercises We have tried to provide as many examples as possible. In particular, there are many examples that show a fragment of code which can be evaluated. We use a long arrow to indicate the result you obtain when you select an expression and from its context menu choose print it: In case you want to play with these code snippets in Pharo, you can download a plain text file with all the example code from the Resources sidebar of the book s web site: http: books.pharo.org . Acknowledgments We would like to thank Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls and their team for making Squeak, an amazing Smalltalk development environment, that became the open-source project from which Pharo took roots. Pharo also would not be possible without the incredible work of the Squeak developers. We would also like to thank Hilaire Fernandes and Serge Stinckwich who allowed us to translate parts of their columns on Smalltalk, and Damien Cassou for contributing the chapter on Streams. We especially thank Alexandre Bergel, Orla Greevy, Fabrizio Perin, Lukas Renggli, Jorge Ressia and Erwann Wernli for their detailed reviews. We thank the University of Bern, Switzerland, for graciously supporting this open-source project and for hosting the web site of this book. We also thank the Pharo community for their enthusiastic support of
