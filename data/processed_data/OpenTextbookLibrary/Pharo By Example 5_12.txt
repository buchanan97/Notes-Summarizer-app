converts it to machine code and executes it. Pharo comes with the Cog VM a very fast JITing VM. The VM executable is named: Pharo.exe for Windows; pharofor Linux ; and Pharofor OSX (inside a package also named Pharo.app ). The other components below are portable across operating systems, and can be copied and run on any appropriate virtual machine. .Thesources file contains source code for parts of Pharo that do not change frequently. Sources file is important because the image file format stores only objects including compiled methods and their bytecode and not their source code. Typically a new sources file is generated once per major release of Pharo. For Pharo , this file is named Pharo V50.sources . .Thechanges file logs of all source code modifications (especially all the changes you did while programming) since the .sources file was generated. Each release provides a near empty file named for the release, for example Pharo5. .changes . This facilitates a per method history for diffs or reverting. It means that even if you did not manage to save the image file on a crash or you just forgot, you can recover your changes from this file. A changes file is always coupled with a image file. They work in pair. Launching Pharo .Theimagefile provides a frozen in time snapshot of a running Pharo system. This is the file where all objects are stored and as such it s a cross platform format. An image file contains the live state of all objects of the system (including classes and compiled methods, since they are objects too) at a given point. An image is a virtual object container. The file is
