is considered a bad and inefficient coding method. Get into the habit of using locals as the norm and resort to globals only when called for. Embedded Controllers If you have a multiple file project, how do you get the functions in the second file to recognize the globals declared in the first file? In this case, you ll create a header file and use the include directive. For example, suppose your project consists of two C source files named foo.c and bar.c. In foo.c you declare the following global: int m; In order for the functions in bar.c to see m, you ll create a header file, perhaps called foo.h. foo.h will contain the following: extern int m; Meaning that an integer named m has been declared externally (i.e., in another file). At the top of bar.c you ll add the line: include foo.h So, when bar.c is compiled, the compiler will first open up foo.h. It will see that the variable m has been declared elsewhere and puts it in a known variables list . It then continues to compile the remainder of you code. When it comes across m in some function, the compiler understands that this is a variable that was declared in another file. No problem! So, you can now see that header files are largely composed of definitions and declarations from other places, namely external data and function prototypes. Exercises . Assume a function declares a variable like so: static int x ; The function increments the variable and then prints its value. What does the function print out on the tenth call to the function? How would this change if the static keyword
