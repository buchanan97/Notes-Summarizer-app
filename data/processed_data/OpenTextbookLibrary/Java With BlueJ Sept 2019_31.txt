The String class has a method equals and another method named equals Ignore Case . Both of these methods require an argument to be passed. If we want to compare two strings, sa y s1 and s2, to see if they are equal we can use either of these two expressions: s1.equals(s2) s2.equals(s1) Both must return the same boolean value. The following program initializes two strings and then displays the value when they are compared fo r equality. Note line , repeated here: boolean equals Result s1.equals(s2); On the right hand side of the assignment operator is the expression: s1.equals(s2) We say, in object -oriented terms, that we are asking the object s1 to execute its equals() met hod with the argument s2. When line executes the method is invoked, a value is returned to this point in the statement, and that result is assigned to the boolean variable equals Result .
