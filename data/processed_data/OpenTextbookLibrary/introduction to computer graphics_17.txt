some information has been lost. T his might not sound like a good idea, but in fact the di erence is often not very noticeable, and using lossy compression usually permits a greater reduction in the size of the compressed dat a. JPEG generally works well for photographic images, but not as well for images that have sha rp edges between di erent colors. It is especially bad for line drawings and images that contai n text; PNG is the preferred format for such images. Web P can use both lossless and lossy compres sion. SVG, on the other hand, is fundamentally a vector graphics fo rmat (although SVG images can include raster images). SVG is actually an XML-based lan guage for describing twodimensional vector graphics images. SVG stands for Scal able Vector Graphics, and the term scalable indicates one of the advantages of vector gr aphics: There is no loss of quality when the size of the image is increased. A line between two poi nts can be represented at any scale, and it is still the same perfect geometric line. If you try to greatly increase the size of a raster image, on the other hand, you will nd that you don t h ave enough color values for all the pixels in the new image; each pixel from the original i mage will be expanded to cover a rectangle of pixels in the scaled image, and you will get mult i-pixel blocks of uniform color. The scalable nature of SVG images make them a good choice for web b rowsers and for graphical elements on your computer s desktop. And indeed, some deskt op environments are now
