structures that give incorrect answers to queries or don t perform updates properly. We will, however, see data structures that make an extra e ort to keep space usage to a minimum. This won t usually a ect the (asymptotic) running times of operations, but can make the data structures a little slower in practice. When studying running times in the context of data structures we tend to come across three di erent kinds of running time guarantees: Worst-case running times: These are the strongest kind of running time guarantees. If a data structure operation has a worst-case running time off(n), then one of these operations never takes longer than f(n) time. Amortized running times: If we say that the amortized running time of an operation in a data structure is f(n), then this means that the cost of a typical operation is at most f(n). More precisely, if a data structure has an amortized running time of f(n), then a sequence ofmoperations takes at most mf(n) time. Some individual operations may take more than f(n) time but the average, over the entire sequence of operations, is at most f(n). Expected running times: If we say that the expected running time of an operation on a data structure is f(n), this means that the actual running time is a random variable (see Section ) and the expected value of this random variable is at most f(n). The randomization here is with respect to random choices made by the data structure. To understand the di erence between worst-case, amortized, and expected running times, it helps to consider a nancial example. Consider the cost of buying a house: Correctness, Time Complexity, and
