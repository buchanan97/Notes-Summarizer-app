in frustration at the multitude of concepts and details he or she must understand before writing the simplest program. The simpler a programming environment, the easier it is to write and run small programs, and the more work it is to write substantial, useful programs. In the early days of computing, before the proliferation of programming languages during the 1960s, most programmers worked in environments that were exceedingly simple by modern standards: Acquaintance with an assembler, a loader, and a small program library sufficed. The programs they wrote were small compared to what a professional programmer writes today. The simpler a programming environment is, the better suited it is for learning to program. Alas, today simple environments are hard to find! Even a home computer is equipped with complex software that is not easily ignored or bypassed. For the sake of education it is useful to invent artificial programming environments. Their only purpose is to illustrate some important concepts in the simplest possible setting and to facilitate insight. Part I of this book introduces such a toy This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License programming environment suitable for programming graphics and motion, and illustrates how it can gradually be enriched to approach a simple but useful graphics environment. Textbooks on computer graphics. The computer-driven graphics screen is a powerful new medium for communication. Visualization often makes it possible to present the results of a computation in intuitively appealing ways that convey insights not easily gained in any other manner. To exploit this medium, every programmer must master basic visualization techniques. We refer the reader interested in a systematic introduction to computer graphics to such excellent textbooks as
