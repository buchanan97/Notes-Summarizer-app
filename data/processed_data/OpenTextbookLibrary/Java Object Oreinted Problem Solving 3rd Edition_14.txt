that enables them to be connected to various-sized networks of computers. Networks allow many individual users to share costly computer resources, such as a high-speed printer or a large disk drive or application server that is used to store and distribute both data and programs to the computers on the network. Networks can range in size from local area networks (LANs) , which connect computers and peripherals over a relatively small area, such as within a lab or a building, through wide area networks (WANs) , which can span large geographic areas, such as cities and nations. Client server computing Application servers are just one example of client server computing , a computing approach made possible by networks. According to this approach, certain computers on the network are set up as servers , which provide certain well-de ned services to client computers. For example, one computer in a network may be set up as the email server , with the responsi SECTION Networks, the Internet and the World Wide Web bility of sending, receiving, and storing mail for all users on the network. To access their email on the email server, individual users employ client application software that resides on their desktop computers, such as Outlook Express or Eudora or Pine. Similarly, another server may be set up as a Web server , with the responsibility of storing and serving up Web pages for all the users on the network. Users can run Web browsers, another type of client software, to access Web pages on the server. Java is particularly well suited for these types of networked ordistributed applications, where part of the application software resides on a server and
