Remember, the fractional part is meaningless, and thus lost, on integer divides. Casting is also useful when using math functions. If you have to use float, you can cast them to from double to make use of functions defined with double. For example, suppose a, b, and c are declared as float but you wish to use the pow() function to raise a to the b power. pow() is defined as taking two double arguments and returning a double answer. c (float)pow( (double)a, (double)b ); This is a very explicit example. Many times you can rely on a silent cast promotion to do your work for you as in the integer example above. Sometimes being explicit is a good practice just as a form of documentation. Embedded Controllers Bitwise Operations Sometimes you d like to perform bitwise operations rather than ordinary math. For example, what if you want to logically AND two variables, bit by bit? Bitwise operations are very common when programming microcontrollers as a means of setting, clearing and testing specific bits in control registers (for example, setting a specific pin on a digital port to read mode instead of write mode). C has a series of bitwise operators. They are: AND OR XOR One s Complement Shift Right Shift Left Figure , bitwise operators Note the double use of for address of and now AND. The unary operation is always address of , and the binary operation is always AND, so a b would not imply the address of b. If you wanted to AND x with y, shift the result places to the left and assign the result to z, you d use: z (x y)
