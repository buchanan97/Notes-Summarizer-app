Chirp. Here's the code that makes one: signal thinkdsp.Expo Chirp(start , end ) wave signal.make wave(duration ) You can listen to these examples in chap03.ipynb and compare the linear and exponential chirps. Spectrum of a chirp What do you think happens if you compute the spectrum of a chirp? Here's an example that constructs a one-second, one-octave chirp and its spectrum: signal thinkdsp.Chirp(start , end ) wave signal.make wave(duration ) spectrum wave.make spectrum() . Spectrogram Frequency (Hz)050100150200250300350400450 Amplitude Figure : Spectrum of a one-second one-octave chirp. Figure shows the result. The spectrum has components at every frequency from to Hz, with variations that look a little like the Eye of Sauron (seehttp: en.wikipedia.org wiki Sauron ). The spectrum is approximately at between and Hz, which indicates that the signal spends equal time at each frequency in this range. Based on that observation, you should be able to guess what the spectrum of an exponential chirp looks like. The spectrum gives hints about the structure of the signal, but it obscures the relationship between frequency and time. For example, we cannot tell by looking at this spectrum whether the frequency went up or down, or both. Spectrogram To recover the relationship between frequency and time, we can break the chirp into segments and plot the spectrum of each segment. The result is called a short-time Fourier transform (STFT). There are several ways to visualize a STFT, but the most common is a spectrogram , which shows time on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis. Each column in the spectrogram shows the spectrum of a short segment, using color or grayscale to represent amplitude. As an example, I'll compute the spectrogram
