Ba y es's Theorem Whic h means there are t w o w a ys to compute the conjunction. If y ou ha v e p(A) , y ou m ultiply b y the conditional probabilit y p(Bj A) . Or y ou can do it the other w a y around; if y ou kno w p(B) , y ou m ultiply b y p(Aj B) . Either w a y y ou should get the same thing. Finally w e can divide through b y p(B) : p(Aj B) p(A) p(Bj A) p(B) And that's Ba y es's theorem! It migh t not lo ok lik e m uc h, but it turns out to b e surprisingly p o w erful. F or example, w e can use it to solv e the co okie problem. I'll write B1 for the h yp othesis that the co okie came from Bo wl and V for the v anilla co okie. Plugging in Ba y es's theorem w e get p(B1j V) p(B1) p(Vj B1) p(V) The term on the left is what w e w an t: the probabilit y of Bo wl , giv en that w e c hose a v anilla co okie. The terms on the righ t are: p(B1) : This is the probabilit y that w e c hose Bo wl , unconditioned b y what kind of co okie w e got. Since the problem sa ys w e c hose a b o wl at random, w e can assume p(B1) . p(Vj B1) : This is the probabilit y of getting a v anilla co okie from Bo
