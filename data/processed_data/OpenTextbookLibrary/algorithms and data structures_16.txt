the user point the mouse-driven cursor to some spot on the screen. The 'procedure Get Mouse(v, h)' returns the coordinates of the grid point where the cursor is located at the moment 'Get Mouse' is executed. Thus we can track and paint the path of the mouse by a loop such as repeat Get Mouse(v, h); Paint Oval(v , h , v , h ) until stop; This does not give the user any timing control over when he or she wants the computer to read the coordinates of the mouse cursor. Clicking the mouse button is the usual way to tell the computer "Now!". A predefined boolean function 'Button' returns 'true' when the mouse button is depressed, 'false' when not. We often synchronize program execution with the user's clicks by programming busy waiting loops: repeat until Button; waits for the button to be pressed while Button do; waits for the button to be released The following procedure waits for the next click: procedure wait For Click; begin repeat until Button; while Button do end; Pixel acrobatics The Quick Draw pen has four parameters that can be set to draw lines or paint textures of great visual variety: pen location 'pn Loc', pen size 'pn Size' (a rectangle of given height and width), a pen pattern 'pn Pat', and a drawing mode 'pn Mode'. The pixels affected by a motion of the pen are shown in Exhibit . Exhibit : Footprint of the pen. Predefined values of 'pn Pat' include 'black', 'gray', and 'white'. 'pn Pat' is set by calling the predefined 'procedure Pen Pat(pat: Pattern)' e.g. 'Pen Pat(gray)' . As 'white' is the default background, drawing in 'white' usually
