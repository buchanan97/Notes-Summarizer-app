correctly on different types of machines. To address this issue, Java isbothcompiled and interpreted. Instead of translating source code directly into an executable, the Java compiler generates code for avirtual machine. This imaginary machine has the functionality common to desktops, laptops, tablets, phones, etc. Its language, called Java byte code, looks like object code and is easy and fast to interpret. Asaresult,it spossibletocompilea Javaprogramononemachine,transferthe byte code to another machine, and run the byte code on that other machine. Figure shows the steps of the development process. The Java compiler is a program namedjavac. It translates.javafiles into.classfiles that store the resulting byte code. The Java interpreter is another program, namedjava, which is short for Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Figure : The process of compiling and running a Java program. The programmer writes source code in the file Hello.javaand usesjavacto compile it. If there are no errors, the compiler saves the byte code in the file Hello.class. To run the program, the programmer usesjavato interpret the byte code. The result of the program is then displayed on the screen. Although it might seem complicated, these steps are automated for you in most development environments. Usually, you only have to press a button or type a single command to compile and interpret your program. On the other hand, it is important to know what steps are happening in the background, so if something goes wrong you can figure out what it is. Displaying Two Messages You can put as many statements as you like in themainmethod. For example, to display more than one line of output: Formatting Source Code public class Hello2 public static void main(String args) generate some simple output System.out.println("Hello, World!");
