simply our screen, keyboard, mouse, microphone, speaker, touchpad, etc. They are all of the ways we interact with the computer. These days, most computers also have a Network Connection to retrieve information over a network. We can think of the network as a very slow place to store and retrieve data that might not always be up . So in a sense, the network is a slower and at times unreliable form of Secondary Memory . While most of the detail of how these components work is best left to computer builders, it helps to have some terminology so we can talk about these di erent parts as we write our programs. CHAPTER . WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN TO WRITE PROGRAMS? Input and Output Devices Software Main Memory Central Processing Unit What Next? Network Secondary Memory Figure : Where Are You? As a programmer, your job is to use and orchestrate each of these resources to solve the problem that you need to solve and analyze the data you get from the solution. As a programmer you will mostly be talking to the CPU and t elling it what to do next. Sometimes you will tell the CPU to use the main memory, secondary memory, network, or the input output devices. You need to be the person who answers the CPU s What next? question. But it would be very uncomfortable to shrink you down to 5mm tall and insert you int o the computer just so you could issue a command three billion times per second. So instead, you must write down your instructions in advance. We call these stored instructions a program and the act of writing these
