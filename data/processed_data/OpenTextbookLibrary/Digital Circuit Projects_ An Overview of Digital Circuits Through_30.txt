is then easier to see what terms are in common, and to reduce the Boolean expression . For example a -variabl e Kmap for a function F(A,B) would be represented as follows, with the values of A in rows and the values of B in the columns. A B A'B' A'B AB' AB Table - : -Variable K -Map In this table , the rows correspond to A and not -A, and the columns correspond to B and not -B. Table - : A A' for -variable K -map Table - : B B' for a - variable K -map DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS Since the K -map has grouped the terms together, it is easier to find a minimum Boolean equation. For example, consider the following truth table: Input Output A B AND Table - : Truth Table for -variable K -map problem. This truth table maps to the following K -map. In this K -map groups of 2n adjacent items are found, which for a - variable K -map can only be groups of , and . In this map there are groups of , as shown below. Table - : Solving a -variable K -map The two grouping found correspond to A' and B', so the final equation for this K -map is A' B'. Two variable K -maps are trivial, and so not very interesting. The next two section will show how to solve the K -maps for more and variables. -Variable Karnaugh Maps -variable K -maps correspond to Boolean functions of the f orm f(A, B, C). The K -maps again allow a truth table to be mapped so that rows that differ by or
