(hosted on a public internet, shared among consumers) or private (cloud concepts of provisioning and storage are applied to servers within a fire wall or internal network that is privately managed), and can also fall into some smaller subsets in between, as depicted in the graphic above. Under Infrastructure as a Service (Iaa S) computing model, which is what is most com - monly associated with the term cloud computing, one or more servers with significant amounts of processing power, capacity, and memory, are configured through hardware and The Missing Link: An Introduction to Web Development and Programming Chapter or software methods to act as though they are multiple smaller systems that add up to their capacity. This is referred to as virtualizing, or virtual servers. These systems can be right sized where they only consume the resources they need on average, meaning many systems needing little resources can reside on one piece of hardware. When processing demands of one system expand or contract, resources from that server can be added or removed to account for the change. This is an alternative to multiple physical servers, where each would need the ability to serve not only the average but expected peak needs of system resources. Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, and the ever-expanding list of as-a-service models follow the same basic pattern of balancing time and effort. Platforms as a service allow central control of end user profiles, and software as a service allows simplified (and or automated) updating of programs and configurations. Storage as a service can replace the need to manually process backups and file server maintenance. Effectively, each asa-service strives to provide the end
