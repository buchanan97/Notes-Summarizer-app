only platforms on which Java Script is used. Some databases, such as Mongo DB and Couch DB, use Java Script as their scripting and query language. Several platforms for desktop and server programming, most notably the Node.js project (the subject of Chapter ), provide an environment for programming Java Script outside of the browser. Code,andwhattodowithit Codeis the text that makes up programs. Most chapters in this book contain quite a lot of code. I believe reading code and writing code are indispensable parts of learning to program. Try to not just glance over the examples read them attentively and understand them. This may be slow and confusing at first, but I promise that you ll quickly get the hang of it. The same goes for the exercises. Don t assume you understand them until you ve actually written a working solution. I recommend you try your solutions to exercises in an actual Java Script interpreter. That way, you ll get immediate feedback on whether what you are doing is working, and, I hope, you ll be tempted to experiment and go beyond the exercises. The easiest way to run the example code in the book and to experiment withit istolookitupintheonlineversionofthebookat https: eloquentjavascript.net . There, you can click any code example to edit and run it and to see the output it produces. To work on the exercises, go to https: eloquentjavascript.net code, which provides starting code for each coding exercise and allows you to look at the solutions. Running the programs defined in this book outside of the book s website requires some care. Many examples stand on their own and should work in any Java Script environment. But code
