backward, looking at the output of the program, trying to figure out why it is doing the wrong thing, and how to make it do the right thing. Usually, the compiler and the interpreter can t help you, since they don t know what the right thing is. Vocabulary variable:A named storage location for values. All variables have a type, which is declared when the variable is created. Chapter Variables and Operators value:A number, string, or other data that can be stored in a variable. Every value belongs to a type (e.g.,intor String). type:Mathematically speaking, a set of values. The type of a variable determines which values it can have. declaration:A statement that creates a new variable and specifies its type. keyword:A reserved word used by the compiler to analyze programs. You cannot use keywords (likepublic,class, andvoid) as variable names. assignment:A statement that gives a value to a variable. initialize:To assign a variable for the first time. state:The variables in a program and their current values. memory diagram:A graphical representation of the state of a program at a point in time. operator:A symbol that represents a computation like addition, multiplication, or string concatenation. operand:One of the values on which an operator operates. Most operators in Java require two operands. expression:A combination of variables, operators, and values that represents a single value. Expressions also have types, as determined by their operators and operands. floating-point:A data type that represents numbers with an integer part and a fractional part. In Java, the default floating-point type isdouble. rounding error:The difference between the number we want to represent and the nearest floating-point number. concatenate:To join two values, often strings, end to end. order of operations:Therulesthatdetermineinwhatorderexpressionsare
