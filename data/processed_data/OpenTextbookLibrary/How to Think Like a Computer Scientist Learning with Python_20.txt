that contain Python programs have names that end with .py. To execute the program, we have to tell the interpreter the name of the script: python latoya.py In other development environments, the details of executing programs may di er. Also, most programs are more interesting than this one. Most of the examples in this book are executed on the command line. Working on the command line is convenient for program development and testing, because you can type programs and execute them immediately. Once you have a working program, you should store it in a script so you can execute or modify it in the future. What is a program? Aprogram is a sequence of instructions that speci es how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or nding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program. The details look di erent in di erent languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language: input: Get data from the keyboard, a le, or some other device. The way of the program output: Display data on the screen or send data to a le or other device. math: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication. conditional execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements. repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation. Believe it or not, that s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you v e ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look
