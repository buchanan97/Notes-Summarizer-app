Algorithms and Data Structures A Global Text Table of Contents Part I: Programming environments for motion, graphics, and geometry . Reducing a task to given primitives: programming motion A robot car, its capabilities, and the task to be performed Wall-following algorithm described informally Algorithm specified in a high-level language Algorithm programmed in the robot's language The robot's program optimized . Graphics primitives and environments Turtle graphics: a basic environment Quick Draw: a graphics toolbox A graphics frame program . Algorithm animation Computer-driven visualization: characteristics and techniques A gallery of algorithm snapshots Part II: Programming concepts: beyond notation . Algorithms and programs as literature: substance and form Programming in the large versus programming in the small Documentation versus literature: is it meant to be read? Pascal and its dialects: lingua franca of computer science . Divide-and-conquer and recursion An algorithmic principle Divide-and-conquer expressed as a diagram: merge sort Recursively defined trees Recursive tree traversal Recursion versus iteration: the Tower of Hanoi The flag of Alfanumerica: an algorithmic novel on iteration and recursion . Syntax Syntax and semantics Grammars and their representation: syntax diagrams and EBNF An overly
