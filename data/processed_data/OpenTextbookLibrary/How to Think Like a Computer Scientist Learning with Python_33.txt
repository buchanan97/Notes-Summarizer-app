an expression, the order of evaluation depends on the rules of precedence . Python follows the same precedence rules for its mathematical operators that mathematics does. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember the order of operations: Variables, expressions and statements Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated rst, ( - ) is , and ( ) ( - ) is . You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute ) , even though it doesn t change the result. Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so is and not , and3 is and not . Multiplication and Division have the same precedence, which is higher than Addition and Subtraction, which also have the same precedence. So - yields rather than , and - is- , not1(remember that in integer division, ). Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right. So in the expression minute , the multiplication happens rst, yielding 5900 , which in turn yields . If the operations had been evaluated from right to left, the result would have been , which is , which is wrong. Operations on strings In general, you cannot perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings look like numbers. The following are illegal (assuming that message has typestring ): message- Hello message Hello Interestingly, the operator does work with strings, although it does not do exactly what you might expect. For strings, the operator represents concatenation , which means joining the two operands by linking them end-to-end. For example:
