a string , so called because it contains a string of letters. You (and the interpreter) can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks. Theprint statement also works for integers. We use the python command to start the interpreter. python print( ) If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you. type( quotesingle.ts1 Hello, World! quotesingle.ts1 ) class quotesingle.ts1str quotesingle.ts1 type( ) class quotesingle.ts1int quotesingle.ts1 Not surprisingly, strings belong to the type strand integers belong to the type int. Less obviously, numbers with a decimal point belong to a type called float , because these numbers are represented in a format called oating point . type( ) class quotesingle.ts1float quotesingle.ts1 What about values like and ? They look like numbers, but they are in quotation marks like strings. CHAPTER .

When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of three digits, as in , , . This is not a legal integer in Pyt hon, but it is legal: print( , , ) Well, that s not what we expected at all! Python interprets , , as a co mmaseparated sequence of integers, which it prints with spaces between. This is the rst example we have seen of a semantic error: the code runs without producing an error message, but it doesn t do the right thing. Variables One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables . A variable is a name that refers to a value.
