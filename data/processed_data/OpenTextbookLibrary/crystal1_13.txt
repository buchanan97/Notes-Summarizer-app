numbers, you might wonder why we bother to define two different types for these. Why not just give both kinds of variables the same real number type? Basically, the answer is that something feels wrong about that to the Data Science community. A Facebook user might have friends, or , but it would never make sense for her to have friends. A consensus has thus arisen: variables that would only ever store whole numbers really ought to be of a type that s devoted to only whole numbers. You can violate this convention, but you ll be thought weird by your fellow developers if you do so. Text Lastly, somevaluesobviouslyaren tnumericatall, likeacustomer s name, a show title, or a tweet. So our third type of data is textual. Variables of this type have a sequence of characters as values. Thesecharactersaremostoften Englishletters, butcanalsoinclude spaces, punctuation, and characters from other alphabets. By the way, this third data type can tiptoe right up to the atomic line and sometimes cross it. In other words, we will occasionally work with text valuesnon-atomically, by splitting them up into their constituent words or even letters. Most of the time, though, we ll treat a character sequence like"Avengers: Endgame"as a single, indivisible chunk of data in the same way we treat a number like42. But what about ? What about other things a computer can store: images, song files, videos? It turns out that through clever tricks, all these kinds of media and more can be boiled down to a large number of integers, CHAPTER . THREE KINDS OF ATOMIC DATA and stored in an aggregate data structure like those discussed in the next chapter. At the
