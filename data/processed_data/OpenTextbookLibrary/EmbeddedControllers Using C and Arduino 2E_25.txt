to go through a loop times. The loop will never terminate because an bit integer can t go up that high. You keep adding one to it, but it keeps flipping back to after it hits . This behavior is not all bad; it can, in fact, be put to good use with things like interrupts and timers, as we shall see. What happens if you mix different types of variables? For example, what happens if you divide a double by an int or a float by double? C will promote the lesser size precision types to the larger type and then do the operation. This can sometimes present a problem if you try to assign the result back to something smaller, even if you know it will always fit . The compiler will complain if you divide a long int by another long int and try to assign the result to a short int. You can get around this by using a cast. This is your way of telling the compiler that you know there is a potential problem, but to go ahead anyway (hopefully, because you know it will always work, not just because you want to defeat the compiler warning). Casting in C is similar to type conversion in Python (e.g., the int() function). Here s an example. short int x, y ; long int z ; x (short int)(y z); Note how you are directing the compiler to turn the division into a short int. Otherwise, the result is in fact a long int due to the promotion of y to the level of z. What s the value of x? Why it s of course!
