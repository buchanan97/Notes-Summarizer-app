might display the stored output at unexpected times or even terminate without displaying anything. Chapter Variables and Operators Arithmetic Operators Operatorsare symbols that represent simple computations. For example, the addition operator is , subtraction is-, multiplication is , and division is . The following program converts a time of day to minutes: int hour ; int minute ; System.out.print("Number of minutes since midnight: "); System.out.println(hour minute); The output is as follows: Number of minutes since midnight: In this program,hour minuteis anexpression, which represents a single value to be computed ( ). When the program runs, each variable is replaced by its current value, and then the operators are applied. The values that operators work with are calledoperands. Expressions are generally a combination of numbers, variables, and operators. When compiled and executed, they become a single value. For example, the expression1 1has the value2. In the expressionhour - , Java replaces the variable with its value, yielding11 - , which has the value10. In the expressionhour minute, both variables get replaced, yielding . The multiplication happens first, yielding660 . Then the addition yields719. Addition, subtraction, and multiplication all do what you expect, but you might be surprised by division. For example, the following fragment tries to compute the fraction of an hour that has elapsed: System.out.print("Fraction of the hour that has passed: "); System.out.println(minute ); The output is as follows: Fraction of the hour that has passed: Floating-Point Numbers This result often confuses people. The value ofminuteis59, and divided by should be , not . The problem is that Java performsinteger divisionwhen the operands are integers. By design, integer division always rounds toward zero, even in cases like this one where
