been chosen such that, in typical expressions like the following one, as few parentheses as possible are necessary: The last logical operator we will look at is not unary, not binary, but ternary, operating on three values. It is written with a question mark and a colon, like this: console.log(true ? : ); console.log(false ? : ); This one is called the conditional operator (or sometimes just the ternary operatorsince it is the only such operator in the language). The operator uses the value to the left of the question mark to decide which of the two other values to pick . If you write a ? b : c , the result will be bwhen ais true and c otherwise. Emptyvalues There are two special values, written nulland undefined , that are used to denote the absence of a meaningful value. They are themselves values, but they carry no information. Many operations in the language that don t produce a meaningful value yield undefined simply because they have to yield somevalue. The difference in meaning between undefined and nullis an accident of Java Script s design, and it doesn t matter most of the time. In cases where you actually have to concern yourself with these values, I recommend treating them as mostly interchangeable. Automatictypeconversion In theintroduction , I mentioned that Java Script goes out of its way to accept almost any program you give it, even programs that do odd things. This is nicely demonstrated by the following expressions: console.log( null) console.log(" " - ) console.log(" " ) console.log("five" ) Na N console.log(false ) true When an operator is applied to the wrong type of value, Java Script
