of the later chapters and explains one important category of service provided by operating systems and middleware. Section explains how a single computer can run several computations concurrently, a topic addressed in more depth by Chapters and . Section explains how interactions between those concurrent computations can be kept under control, the topic of Chapters through . Sections and extend the range of interacting computations across time and space, respectively, through mechanisms such as le systems and networking. They preview Chapter and Chapters and . Finally, Section introduces the topic of security, a topic I revisit at the end of each chapter and then focus on in Chapter . What Is an Operating System? Anoperating system is software that uses the hardware resources of a computer system to provide support for the execution of other software. Specifically, an operating system provides the following services: The operating system allows multiple computations to take place concurrently on a single computer system. It divides the hardware's time between the computations and handles the shifts of focus between the computations, keeping track of where each one leaves o so that it can later correctly resume. The operating system controls the interactions between the concurrent computations. It can enforce rules, such as forbidding computations from modifying data structures while other computations are accessing those structures. It can also provide isolated areas of memory for private use by the di erent computations. The operating system can provide support for controlled interaction of computations even when they do not run concurrently. In particular, general-purpose operating systems provide le systems, which allow computations to read data from les written by earlier computations. This feature is optional because an
