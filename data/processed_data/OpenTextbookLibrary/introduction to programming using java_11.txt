Thesameistruefor an intellectual journe y, such aslearningtowritecomputer programs. In this case, you ll need to know the basics of what computers are and how they work. You ll want to have some idea of what a computer program is and how one is created. Since you will be writing programs in the Java programming la nguage, you ll want to know something about that language in particular and about the mo dern computing environment for which Java is designed. As you read this chapter, don t worry if you can t understand everything in detail. (In fact, it would be impossible for you to learn all the details from th e brief expositions in this chapter.) Concentrate on learning enough about the big ideas to orient yourself, in preparation for the rest of the book. Most of what is covered in this chapter will b e covered in much greater detail later in the book. The Fetch and Execute Cycle: Machine Language Acomputer is a complex system consisting of many di erent components. But at the heart or the brain, if you want of the computer is a single co mponent that does the actual computing. This is the Central Processing Unit , or CPU. In a modern desktop computer, the CPU is a single chip on the order of one square inch in siz e. The job of the CPU is to execute programs. Aprogram is simply
