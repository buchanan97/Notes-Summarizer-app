It also provides a listing of all materials needed to implement the circuits covered in this text. Computers and magic While most would not admit it, people believe that computers actually obey the laws of magic . Computers do such wild and miraculous things that somehow we all believe computers are not really machines at all, but there is something very strange and magical which must go on inside of a computer. Computers seem to do things which are beyond the physical laws of nature. And the growth in the capability of the devices which we use every day, which are small and simple to use yet so amazing in what they can do, reinforces this idea that computers are indeed magic. In reality, we know computers are simply machines. The first machine ever designed that had all the functionality of a modern computer, the analytical engine , was designed by Charles Babbage in 1838. The analytical engine was to be purely mechanical and designed to ru n on steam. While it was never implemented, it is a perfectly workable design, and incorporates all the necessary functionality of a modern computer. The analytical engine shows that computers can be understood in purely mechanical terms. To aid in under standing computers, this text will look at the heart of all computers, the Central Processing Unit (CPU ). The first step in understanding computer is to understand a CPU. A CPU is entirely made up of wires and
