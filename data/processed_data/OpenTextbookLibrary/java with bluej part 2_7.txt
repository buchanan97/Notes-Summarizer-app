- that is left as an exercise. CHAPTER . ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS Partially lled arrays In our examples so far the arrays are completely full - every element has a value. In general we do not expect this to always be the case and so, for some applications, we keep track of how many locations are actually lled. Example Partially lled: calculate average Suppose we need to calculate the average monthly sales. Since there are months we use an array of length . We want a user to use the program at any time of year and so there may be fewer than values. The program prompts the user for the monthly sales values, and requests the last value entered to be - (a stopper value). The program keeps track of how many elements are lled. Consider the following program and the points discussed after the listing: Listing : Average sales for up to months. 1import java . util . Scanner ; From monthly sales calculate monthly average . 5public class Monthly Sales public static void main ( String args ) double sales new double ; Scanner kb new Scanner ( System .in); System . out . println (" Enter monthly sales " " enter - after last value "); int number Months ; double a Sale kb. next Double (); 1st month while ( a Sale ! - ) sales number Months a Sale ; a Sale kb. next Double (); double sum ; for (int i ; i number Months ; i ) sum sales i ; if ( number Months ) System .out . println ( " average " sum number Months ); .
