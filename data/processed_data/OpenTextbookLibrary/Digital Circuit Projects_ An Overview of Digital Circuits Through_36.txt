to make the circuits as small as possible, and to make the circui ts contain the fewest gates possible. DNF seldom represents the smallest possible circuit, and Boolean algebra is introduced as a way to simplify a circuit. DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS It is difficult to know if a circuit has been reduced to a minimum using just DNF, so the concept of a K -map was introduced which is a mechanical way to ensure minimum circuits. Exercises . De Morgan s Law: a. Show that De Morgan s Law is correct for two variables , (A B ) A B by using a truth table . b. Does De Morgan s Law hold for variables? What about variables? . Simplify the following Boolean expressions using Boolean algebra a. A AB b. A A B c. AB C ABC d. AC AC A B A B . The operations AND, OR, and NOT are universal in that any Boolean function can be implemented using just these three gates. a. Prove by construction that the NAND gate is universal by creating AND, OR, and NOT gates using only the NAND gate. b. Prove by construction that the NOR gate is also universal. c. Why are the AND and OR gate not universal? (e.g. what simple operation cannot be created with just an AND or OR gate?) . For inputs A and B, show how to use an XOR gate to create a NOT gate if B is , and a buffer if B is . . XOR is somet imes called an odd function because the result of an XOR is if the number of s the minterm is odd, the
