improvements are encouraged and highly valued. A community that welcomes coders from any corner of the world with any skill and any programming languages. Pharo strives to offer a lean, open platform for professional software development, as well as a robust and stable platform for research and develop1 Preface ment into dynamic languages and environments. Pharo serves as the reference implementation for the Seaside web development framework available athttp: www.seaside.st . Pharo core contains only code that has been contributed under the MIT license. The Pharo project started in March 2008 as a fork of Squeak (a modern implementation of Smalltalk- ), and the first beta version was released on July , 2009. The current version is Pharo , released in May 2016. Pharo is in alpha development and planned for release in April 2017. Pharo is highly portable. Pharo can run on OS X, Windows, Linux, Android, i OS, and Raspberry Pi. Its virtual machine is written entirely in a subset of Pharo itself, making it easy to simulate, debug, analyze, and change from within Pharo itself. Pharo is the vehicle for a wide range of innovative projects, from multimedia applications and educational platforms to commercial web development environments. There is an important principle behind Pharo: Pharo does not just copy the past, it reinvents the essence of Smalltalk. However we realize that Big Bang style approaches rarely succeed. Pharo instead favors evolutionary and incremental changes. Rather than leaping for the final perfect solution in one big step, a multitude of small changes keeps even the bleeding edge relatively stable while experimenting with important new features and libraries. This facilitates contributions and rapid feedback from the community, on which
