and type n ; this trick works in all scrolling windows. Select now and the right-hand pane shows you the three classes that de ne a method with this name, as shown in Figure . Selecting any one of them will open a browser on it. At other times you may have a good idea that a method exists, but will have no idea what it might be called. The method nder can still help! For example, suppose that you would like to nd a method that turns a string into upper case, for example, it would translate 'eureka' into 'EUREKA' . De ning a new method Figure : The method nder showing three classes that de ne a method named now. Type 'eureka' . 'EUREKA' into the method nder and press the RETURN key, as shown in Figure . The method nder will suggest a method that does what you want. An asterisk at the beginning of a line in the right pane of the method nder indicates that this method is the one that was actually used to obtain the requested result. So, the asterisk in front of String as Uppercase lets us know that the method as Uppercase de ned on the class String was executed and returned the result we wanted. The methods that do not have an asterisk are just the other methods that have the same name as the ones that returned the expected result. So Character as Uppercase was not executed on our example, because 'eureka' is not a Character object. You can also use the method nder for methods with arguments; for example, if you are looking for a method that will
