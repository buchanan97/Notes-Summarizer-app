(as true false) is the "correct" way to represent them. But keep in mind that t his class is about implementing a computer in hardware. There is no correct, or even more correct, way to discuss binary values. How they will be referred to will depend on the way in which the value is being used. Understanding a computer requires the individua l to be adaptable to all of these ways of referring to binary values. They will all be used in this text, though most of the time the binary values of and will be used. Chapter . Binary Whole Numbers The numbering system that everyone learns in school is called decimal or base . This numbering system is called decimal because it has digits, .. . Thus quantities up to can be easily referenced in this system by a single number. Computers use switches that can be either on ( ) or off( ), and so computers use the binary , or base , numbering system. In binary, there are only two digits, and . So values up to can be easily represented by a single digit. Having only the ability to repres ent or items is too limiting to be useful. But then so are the values which can be used in the decimal system. The question is how does the decimal handle the problem of numbers greater than , and can binary use the same idea? In decimal when i s added to the number is created. The number means that there is group of ten numbers, and one number. The number is group of and group of one.
