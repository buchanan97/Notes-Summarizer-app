software and other digital products are purchased and distributed. Similarly, as noted earlier, many businesses have begun to organize their information systems into intranets private networks that implement the HTTP protocol. Currently, one of the biggest areas of development on the Web is commerce. As consumers become more comfortable that credit-card information can be securely transmitted over the Web (as it can over a telephone), the Web will explode as a marketing medium as powerful, perhaps, as television is today. Because Java has been designed to support secure, distributed, networked applications, it is ideally suited to be used as the language for these types of applications. Why Study Programming? Acomputer program is a set of instructions that directs the computer s behavior. Computer programming is the art and science of designing and writing programs. Years ago it was widely believed that entrance into the computer age would require practically everyone to learn how to program. But this did not prove to be true. Today s computers come with so much easy-to-use software that knowing how to use a computer no longer requires programming skills. Another reason to study programming might be to enter into a career as a computer scientist. However, although programming is one of its primary tools, computer science is a broad and varied discipline, which ranges from engineering subjects, such as processor design, to mathematical subjects, such as performance analysis. There are many computer scientists who do little or no programming as part of their everyday work. If you plan to major or minor in computer science, you will certainly learn to program, but good careers in the computing eld are available to programmers and nonprogrammers alike.
