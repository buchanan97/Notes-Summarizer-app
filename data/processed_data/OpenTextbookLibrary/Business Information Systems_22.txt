Many information systems projects are conceived of in a life cycle that progresses in stages from analysis to implementation. The diagram below shows the stages that we touch in the current chapter: Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org books Saylor.org Goal Directed Activities. Implicit in each current and future state are one or more business processes. A business process is a set of goal directed activities. In other words, a process describes the actions To -Be taken to accomplish a task. For example, apply ing to a university, filing taxes, and evaluating employees are all processes. The steps in applying to a university might include filling out an online form, submitting a credit card payment, requesting test scores be sent, and requesting that high school transcripts be sent. Note that all of the processes mentioned above took place even before the advent of computers. Try to imagine how. Information systems simply transform the processes with the goal of making the process more efficient, convenient, effe ctive, reliable, and so forth. First, we represent the current (usually deficient) state As-Is process. Seeing the As -Is process diagrammed exposes obvious areas for improvement in the process. For example, many years ago students registered for classes in person. The As -Is process in that era might have shown a student Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org books Saylor.org waiting in line outside a large auditorium. When his turn comes up, the student enters the auditorium. There are tables representing each department staffed with faculty from that department . For each course that the student wishes to take, he must find the corresponding department table and add his name to the list for that class. Buying concert tickets
