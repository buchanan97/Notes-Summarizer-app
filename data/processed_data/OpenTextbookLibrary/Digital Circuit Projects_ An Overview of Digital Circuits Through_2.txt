The m aterial is presented at a le vel that some one w ith no ex perience in d igital circuits a nd e lectronic s can successfully comp lete the pr ojects, a nd g ain a n unde rstanding of the c ircuits w hich g o into m aking up a comput er. The s econd e dition of thi s include s a ch apter on Boo lean Algebra for pr ofessors who w ould l ike to include a mor e for mal background in to digital circuits. It also ch anged the ch apter de signed to give a c ontext for the CPU to reference a r elatively simp le C PU de velope d by the a uthor in L ogisim. For some one w ho is interested in d igital circuits, thi s boo k is worth do wnloading. Note: O ften it i s easier to us e a MS W ord file rather than a pd f file. If you w ould l ike the boo k as a W ord docume nt and not a pd f, please contact the a uthor a t ckann(at)gettysburg.edu, and he w ill mail it to you. The main r eason for thi s is to get some s ort of fe edback on w ho is usin g the t ext.
