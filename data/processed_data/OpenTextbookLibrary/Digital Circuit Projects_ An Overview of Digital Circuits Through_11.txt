covered. ) An overview of each circuit is given, where the functioning of the circuit and how it is used is explained. Detailed step -by-step instructions with photographs are included with each lab so that the actual wiring of the circuit can be examined. ) Extensive use is made of a powerful yet easy to use circuit design tool named Logisim. Logisim allows the reader to interact with the circuits and components presented in each chapter to understand how they work, and to modify these circuits to implement enhanced functionality for the component. I. Material covered in the text A hobbyist will be most interested in a general understand of what each digital compone nt is, and how it is used in a CPU. They are also interested in implementing successful projects which are fun, while gaining some understanding of the material. DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS Students using this text as a lab manual are more interested in understanding the details of digital circuits, in particular how to the circuits in their Computer Organization class, and often beyond. Since the students will often be online, success in the projects is also a major goal ; as is having fun. Let's face it, actually implementing wor king, physical objects that turn light bulbs on should be, and is, fun. There is no reason not to have fun while enhancing learning. This book is designed to engage both types of readers. Chapters , , and of the book are designed to give the reader some basic understanding of Boolean algebra, how a CPU works, and how to build a circuit on a breadboard. The material on Boolean algebra is not rigorous, and
