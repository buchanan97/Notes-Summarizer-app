native machine language. It d oes this while it is executing the program. Justasforanormalinterpreter, theinputtoajust -in-timecompilerisa Javabytecode program, and its task is to execute that program. But as it is e xecuting the program, it also translates parts of it into the native machine language. The translated parts of the program can then be executed much more quickly than they could be inte rpreted. Since a given part of a program is often executed many times as the program runs, a just-in-time compiler can signi cantly speed up the overall execution time. I should note that there is no necessary connection between J ava and Java bytecode. A program written in Java could certainly be compiled into the machine language of a real computer. And programs written in other languages can be com piled into Java bytecode. However, the combination of Java and Java bytecode is platfo rm-independent, secure, and CHAPTER . THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE network-compatible while allowing you to program in a moder n high-level object-oriented language. There are even some other programming languages that compil e into Java bytecode. The compiled bytecode programs can then be executed by a standar d JVM. New languages that have been developed speci cally for programming the JVM inc lude Scala, Groovy, Clojure, and Processing. Jython and JRuby are versions of older language s, Python and Ruby, that target the JVM. These languages make it possible to enjoy many of the advantages of the JVM while avoiding some of the technicalities of the Java language. In fact, the use of other languages with the JVM has become important enough that several new fea tures have been added to the JVM speci cally
