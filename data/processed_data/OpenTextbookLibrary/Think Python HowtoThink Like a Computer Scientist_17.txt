formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly: Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations. . Formal and natural languages Formal languages tend to have strict syntax rules that govern the structure of statements. For example, in mathematics the statement has correct syntax, but does not. In chemistry H2 Ois a syntactically correct formula, but Zzis not. Syntax rules come in two avors, pertaining to tokens and structure. Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the problems with is that is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as I know). Similarly, Zzis not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation Zz. The second type of syntax rule pertains to the way tokens are combined. The equation is illegal because even though and are legal tokens, you can t have one right after the other. Similarly, in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name, not before. This is well-structured Engli h sentence with invalid t kens in it. This sentence all valid tokens has, but invalid structure with. When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to gure out the structure (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called parsing . Although formal and natural languages have many features in common tokens, structure, and syntax there are some differences: ambiguity: Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that
