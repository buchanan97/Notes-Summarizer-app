probability that the event Eoccurs. In all of the examples in this book, these probabilities are only with respect to the random choices made by the randomized data structure; there is no assumption that the data stored in the structure, nor the sequence of operations performed on the data structure, is random. One of the most important properties of expected values is linearity of expectation . For any two random variables Xand Y, E X Y E X E Y : More generally, for any random variables X1;:::;Xk, E2 666664k X i Xk3 777775 k X i E Xi : Linearity of expectation allows us to break down complicated random variables (like the left hand sides of the above equations) into sums of simpler random variables (the right hand sides). A useful trick, that we will use repeatedly, is de ning indicator random variables . These binary variables are useful when we want to count something and are best illustrated by an example. Suppose we toss a fair coinktimes and we want to know the expected number of times the coin turns up as heads. Intuitively, we know the answer is k , but if we try to prove it using the de nition of expected value, we get E X k X i 0i Prf X ig k X i 0i k i! 2k Introduction k k X i k i! 2k k : This requires that we know enough to calculate that Pr f X ig k i 2k, and that we know the binomial identities i k i k k i and Pk i k i 2k. Using indicator variables and linearity of expectation makes things much
