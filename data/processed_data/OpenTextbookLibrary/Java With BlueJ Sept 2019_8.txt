that a program can use and change as it executes. The Jav a programming language requires us to declare the type of data to be primitive types associated with a variable. Java makes a distinction between primitive data types and other data types defined via classes. In the Java class libraries there are many pre - defined classes, for example: String and System . The Java language contains eight primitive data types: byte , short , int, long , float , double , char and boolean : byte , short , int, and long are used for cases where the data is to be treated as whole numbers (numbers without a fractional component). For example, , , - are whole numbers. These data types differ with regards to the magnitude of number they can represent. float and double are used for cases where the data is numeric and where one expects values to have a fractional component such as: , , - . When written we show them with a decimal point. Again, these two types differ with regards to size in terms of the number of significant digits and in the magnitude of the number they can represent. char is used when there are individual characters to be handled. Examples of individual characters are a , b , q , . Values are enclosed in single quotes. boolean is used when the situation requires one to work with logical values of true and false . In a Java program these values are written just as we do in English: true , false . A Java programmer declares a variable in a declaration statement, and then uses the variable name
