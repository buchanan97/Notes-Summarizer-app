devices such as hard-disks also store streams of bits. There are hardware devices that process the bit stream produced by a hard-disk, but computer scientists have designed lesystems to allow applications to easily access such storage devices. These lesystems are typically divided into several layers as well. Hard-disks store sectors of bytes or more. Unix lesystems group sectors in larger blocks that can contain data or inodes representing the structure of the lesystem. Finally, applications manipulate les and directories that are translated in blocks, sectors and eventually bits by the operating system. Computer networks use a similar approach. Each layer provides a service that is built above the underlying layer and is closer to the needs of the applications. The Datalink layer builds on the service provided by the underlying physical layer. The Datalink layer allows two hosts that are directly connected through the physical layer to exchange information. The unit of information exchanged between two entities in the Datalink layer is a frame. A frame is a nite sequence of bits. Some Datalink layers use variable-length frames while others only use xed-length frames. Some Datalink layers provide a connection-oriented service while others provide a connectionless service. Some Datalink layers provide reliable delivery while others do not guarantee the correct delivery of the information. An important point to note about the Datalink layer is that although the gure below indicates that two entities of the Datalink layer exchange frames directly, in reality this is slightly different. When the Datalink layer entity on the left needs to transmit a frame, it issues as many Data.request primitives to the underlying physical layer as there are bits in the frame. The physical layer
