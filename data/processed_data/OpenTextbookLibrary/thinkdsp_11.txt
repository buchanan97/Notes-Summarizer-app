pyplot is part of matplotlib ; it is included in many Python distributions, or you might have to install it. Atfreq there are periods in seconds, so this plot would look like a solid block of color. To zoom in on a small number of periods, we can use segment , which copies a segment of a Wave and returns a new wave: period mix.period segment wave.segment(start , duration period ) period is a property of a Signal; it returns the period in seconds. start andduration are in seconds. This example copies the rst three periods frommix. The result is a Wave object. . Reading and writing Waves If we plot segment , it looks like Figure . This signal contains two frequency components, so it is more complicated than the signal from the tuning fork, but less complicated than the violin. Reading and writing Waves thinkdsp provides read wave , which reads a WAV le and returns a Wave: violin wave thinkdsp.read wave( input.wav ) And Wave provides write , which writes a WAV le: wave.write(filename output.wav ) You can listen to the Wave with any media player that plays WAV les. On UNIX systems, I use aplay , which is simple, robust, and included in many Linux distributions. thinkdsp also provides play wave , which runs the media player as a subprocess: thinkdsp.play wave(filename output.wav , player aplay ) It usesaplay by default, but you can provide the name of another player. Spectrums Wave provides make spectrum , which returns a Spectrum : spectrum wave.make spectrum() And Spectrum provides plot : spectrum.plot() Spectrum provides three methods that modify the spectrum: low pass applies a low-pass lter, which means
