common integral: Zk xdx lnk : Two of the most common manipulations we do with logarithms are removing them from an exponent: blogbk k and changing the base of a logarithm: logbk logak logab: For example, we can use these two manipulations to compare the natural and binary logarithms lnk logk loge logk (lne) (ln2) (ln2)(logk) :693147logk : Factorials In one or two places in this book, the factorial function is used. For a nonnegative integer n, the notation n! (pronounced nfactorial ) is de ned to mean n! n : Factorials appear because n! counts the number of distinct permutations, i.e., orderings, of ndistinct elements. For the special case n , ! is de ned as . The quantity n! can be approximated using Stirling s Approximation : n! p n n e n e (n); where1 12n (n) 12n: Stirling s Approximation also approximates ln( n!): ln(n!) nlnn n 2ln( n) (n) Introduction (In fact, Stirling s Approximation is most easily proven by approximating ln(n!) ln1 ln2 lnnby the integral Rn 1lnndn nlnn n .) Related to the factorial function are the binomial coe cients . For a non-negative integer nand an integer k2f0;:::;ng, the notation n k denotes: n k! n! k!(n k)!: The binomial coe cient n k (pronounced nchoosek ) counts the number of subsets of an nelement set that have size k, i.e., the number of ways of choosing kdistinct integers from the set f1;:::;ng. Asymptotic Notation When analyzing data structures in this book, we want to talk about the running times of various operations. The exact running times will, of course, vary from computer to computer and even from run to run on
