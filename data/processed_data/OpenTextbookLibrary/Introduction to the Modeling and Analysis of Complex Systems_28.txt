will focus on the latter, the rule-based modeling approach. This is because rule-based modeling plays a particularly important role in complex systems science. More speci cally, developing a rule-based model at microscopic scales and studying its macroscopic behaviors through computer simulation and or mathematical analysis is almost a necessity to understand emergence and self-organization of complex systems. We will discuss how to develop rule-based models and what the challenges are throughout this textbook. A typical cycle of rule-based modeling effort goes through the following steps (which are similar to the cycle of scienti c discoveries we discussed above): . Observe the system of your interest. . Re ect on the possible rules that might cause the system s characteristics that were seen in the observation. . Derive predictions from those rules and compare them with reality. . Repeat the above steps to modify the rules until you are satis ed with the model (or you run out of time or funding). This seems okay, and it doesn t contain the logical problem of proving a hypothesis that we had before, because I loosened the termination criteria to be your satisfaction as a researcher. However, there is still one particular step that is fundamentally dif cult. Which step do you think it is? Of course, each of the four steps has its own unique challenges, but as an educator who has been teaching complex systems modeling for many years, I nd that the second step ( Re ect on possible rules that might cause the system s characteristics seen in the observation. ) is particularly challenging to modelers. This is because this step is so deeply interwoven with the modeler s
