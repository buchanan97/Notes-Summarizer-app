Unless you are both ve ry careful to keep accurate clocks, you can t. Computer systems face the same problem because, even though their clocks are usually accurate, there is always a limit to their precis ion. In addition, most of the time the computer does not keep track of what time t hings happen. There are just too many things happening, too fast, to record the exact time of everything. Puzzle: Assuming that Bob is willing to follow simple instru ctions, is there any way you can guarantee that tomorrow you will eat lunch before Bob? Serialization with messages Serialization with messages One solution is to instruct Bob not to eat lunch until you call . Then, make sure you don t call until after lunch. This approach may seem trivial, but the underlying idea, message passing, is a real solution for many synchronization problems. At the risk of belaboring the obvious, consid er this timeline.
