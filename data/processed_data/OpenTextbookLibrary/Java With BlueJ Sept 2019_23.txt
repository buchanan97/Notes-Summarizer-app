i2"); System.out.println(i1 i2); char Data Type char is used when you need to handle characters individually. When you see a char value in a program you see it enclosed in single quotes, as in: a , A , q , . Java organizes memory for char values so that each value is stored using two bytes of memory. One byte of memory is eight bits. We can consider a bit as being either on or off, or, or . A byte of memory can be considered to be a seq uence of eight s and s. Just for interest, the bit sequences and corresponding integer value for a few characters is listed below: character bit sequence corresponding integer value a 0000000001100001 b 0000000001100010 c 000000000110001 A 0000000001000001 B 0000000001000010 C 0000000001000011 0000000000110000 0000000000110001 0000000000110010 0000000000100100 0000000000100101 0000000000100110 Recall the relational operators compare one value to another, and so these operators produce a boolean value of true or false . These are shown again in the table below; assume x and y are of type char . Relational operators operator meaning example less than x y grea ter than x a less than or equal to a y greater than or equal to x y equal to x y ! not equal to x ! Recall that is the operator used to test for equality, and ! is used to test two values to determine if they are not e qual. Listing illustrates their use in a program. Later on in the section on the Character class you will see useful techniques for analyzing individual characters in a string.
