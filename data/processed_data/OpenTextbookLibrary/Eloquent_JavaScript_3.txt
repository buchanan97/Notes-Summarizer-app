But for unique or open-ended tasks, there often is no appropriate application. That is where programming may come in. Programming is the act of constructinga program asetofpreciseinstructionstellingacomputerwhattodo. Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally tedious and frustrating. Fortunately, if you can get over that fact and maybe even enjoy the rigor of thinking in terms that dumb machines can deal with programming can be rewarding. It allows you to do things in seconds that would take foreverby hand. It is a way to make your computer tool do things that it couldn t do before. On top of that, it makes for a wonderful game of puzzle solving and abstract thinking. Most programming is done with programming languages. A programming language is an artificially constructed language used to instruct computers. It is interesting that the most effective way we ve found to communicate with a computer borrows so heavily from the way we communicate with each other. Like human languages, computer languages allow words and phrases to be combined in new ways, making it possible to express ever new concepts.
