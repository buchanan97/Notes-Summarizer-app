are probably errors, but some represent premature babies. On the other end of the range, the highest values are: weeks count Most doctors recommend induced labor if a pregnancy exceeds weeks, so some of the longer values are surprising. In particular, weeks seems medically unlikely. The best way to handle outliers depends on domain knowledge"; that is, information about where the data come from and what they mean. And it depends on what analysis you are planning to perform. In this example, the motivating question is whether rst babies tend to be early (or late). When people ask this question, they are usually interested in full-term pregnancies, so for this analysis I will focus on pregnancies longer than weeks. First babies Now we can compare the distribution of pregnancy lengths for rst babies and others. I divided the Data Frame of live births using birthord , and computed their histograms: firsts live live.birthord others live live.birthord ! first hist thinkstats2.Hist(firsts.prglngth, label first ) other hist thinkstats2.Hist(others.prglngth, label other ) Then I plotted their histograms on the same axis: Chapter .

For this gure, I use align right andalign left to place corresponding bars on either side of the value. Withwidth , the total width of
