Most b o oks on Ba y esian statistics use mathematical notation and presen t ideas in terms of mathematical concepts lik e calculus. This b o ok uses Python co de instead of math, and discrete appro ximations instead of con tin uous mathematics. As a result, what w ould b e an in tegral in a math b o ok b ecomes a summation, and most op erations on probabilit y distributions are simple lo ops. I think this presen tation is easier to understand, at least for p eople with programming skills. It is also more general, b ecause
