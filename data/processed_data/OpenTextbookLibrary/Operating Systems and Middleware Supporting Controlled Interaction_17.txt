sort of embedded system illustrates what is possible without an operating system. It will also serve as a point of reference as I contrast my de nition of an operating system with an alternative de nition. One popular alternative de nition of an operating system is that it provides application programmers with an abstract view of the underlying hardware resources, taking care of the low-level details so that the applications can be programmed more simply. For example, the programmer can write a simple statement to output a string without concern for the details of making each character appear on the display screen. I would counter by remarking that abstraction can be provided without an operating system, by linking application programs with separately written libraries of supporting procedures. For example, a program could output a string using the standard mechanism of a programming language, such as C or Java. The application programmer would not need to know CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION Application Operating System Application File Application Application Operating Systemnetworking (a) (b) Figure : Without an operating system, a computer can directly execute a single program, as shown in part (a). Part (b) shows that with an operating system, the computer can support concurrent computations, control the interactions between them (suggested by the dashed line), and allow communication across time and space by way of les and networking. anything about hardware. However, rather than running on an operating system, the program could be linked together with a library that performed the output by appropriately manipulating a microwave oven's display panel. Once running on the oven's embedded processor, the library and the application code would be a single program, nothing more than a
