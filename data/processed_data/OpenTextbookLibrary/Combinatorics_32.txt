that she has. For the shirt, we break her choices down into two cases: if she opts for a short-sleeved shirt then she has three choices (of colour), while if she opts for a long-sleeved shirt then she has six choices. In total she has choices for the shirt. Using the product rule, we see that she has options for her gift. Alternatively, we could apply the sum rule first. We will consider the two cases: that Ming buys a short-sleeved shirt; or a long-sleeved shirt. If she buys a short-sleeved shirt, then she has three options for the shirt, and for each of these she has two options for the wrapping, making (by the product rule) options of short-sleeved shirts. If she buys a long-sleeved shirt, then she has six options for the shirt, and for each of these she has two options for the wrapping, making (by the product rule) options of long-sleeved shirts. Using the sum rule, we see that she has options for her gift. EXERCISES .
