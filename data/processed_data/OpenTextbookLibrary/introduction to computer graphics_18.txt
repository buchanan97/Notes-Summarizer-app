using SVG images for their desktop icons. A digital image, no matter what its format, is speci ed using acoordinate system . A coordinate system sets up a correspondence between numbers and geometric points. In two dimensions, each point is assigned a pair of numbers, which a re called the coordinates of the point. The two coordinates of a point are often called its x-coordinate and y-coordinate, although the names x and y are arbitrary. A raster image is a two-dimensional grid of pixels arranged i nto rows and columns. As such, it has a natural coordinate system in which each pixel c orresponds to a pair of integers giving the number of the row and the number of the column that c ontain the pixel. (Even in this simple case, there is some disagreement as to whether th e rows should be numbered from top-to-bottom or from bottom-to-top.) For a vector image, it is natural to use real-number coordina tes. The coordinate system for an image is arbitrary to some degree; that is, the same image c an be speci ed using di erent coordinate systems. I do not want to say a lot about coordinat e systems here, but they will be a major focus of a large part of the book, and they are even more i mportant in three-dimensional graphics than in two dimensions. Elements of D Graphics When we turn to D graphics, we nd that the most common approaches have more in common with vector graphics than with raster graphics. That is, the content of an image is speci ed as a list of geometric objects. The technique is ref erred to as geometric
