can change if you want it to. Even though the following example doesn t make much sense, suppose we wrote this code next: pin count username . A PICTURE OF MEMORY29 This causes not only the contents of the boxes to change, but even their colors. Theusernamevariable was astra moment ago, but now it s anint. Reading from memory Reading from memory just means referring to a variable in order to retrieve its value. So far, we don t know how to do much with that other than print: print("The board has pins.".format(another board, pin count)) The Pink! board has pins. The important point is that the memory picture is the (only) current, reliable record of what memory looks like at any point in a program. Think of it as reflecting a snapshot in time: immediately after some line of code executes and right before the following one does we can consult the picture to obtain the value of each variable. This is exactly what Python does under the hood. I stress this point because I ve seen many students stare at complicated code and try to think out what value each variable will have as it runs. That s hard to do with anything more than a few lines. To keep track of what-has-changed-to-what-and-when, you really need to maintain an up-to-date list of each variable s value as the program executes which is in fact exactly what the memory picture is. CHAPTER . MEMORY PICTURES So if you re trying to figure out what will this program output if I print theodometervariable immediately after line ? don t stare at the code and try to reconstruct its behavior from
