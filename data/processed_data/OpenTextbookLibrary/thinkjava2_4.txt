the book. Using the Code Examples Most of the code examples in this book are available from a Git repository athttps: github.com Chris Mayfield Think Java Code2. Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of the files that make up a project. A collection of files under Git s control is called a repository . PREFACE xi Git Hub is a hosting service that provides storage for Git repositories and a convenient web interface. It provides several ways to work with the code: You can create a copy of the repository on Git Hub by clicking the Fork button. If you don t already have a Git Hub account, you ll need to create one. After forking, you ll have your own repository on Git Hub that you can use to keep track of code you write. Then you can clone the repository, which downloads a copy of the files to your computer. Alternatively, you could clone the original repository without forking. If you choose this option, you don t need a Git Hub account, but you won t be able to save your changes on Git Hub. If you don t want to use Git at all, you can download the code in a ZIP archive using the Clonebutton on the Git Hub page, or this link: https: thinkjava.org code2zip.

The examples in this book were developed and tested using Open JDK . If you are using a more recent version, everything should still work. If you are using an older version, some of the examples might not. Acknowledgments
