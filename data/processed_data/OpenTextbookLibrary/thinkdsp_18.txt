Segment of a square signal at Hz. Square waves thinkdsp also provides Square Signal , which represents a square signal. Here's the class de nition: class Square Signal(Sinusoid): def evaluate(self, ts): cycles self.freq ts self.offset PI2 frac, np.modf(cycles) ys self.amp np.sign(unbias(frac)) return ys Like Triangle Signal ,Square Signal inherits init from Sinusoid , so it takes the same parameters. And the evaluate method is similar. Again, cycles is the number of cycles since the start time, and frac is the fractional part, which ramps from to each period. unbias shiftsfrac so it ramps from - to , then np.sign maps the negative values to - and the positive values to . Multiplying by ampyields a square wave that jumps between -amp andamp. Figure shows three periods of a square wave with frequency Hz, and Figure shows its spectrum. Like a triangle wave, the square wave contains only odd harmonics, which is why there are peaks at , , and Hz, etc. But the amplitude of the .

Speci cally, amplitude drops in proportion to frequency (not frequency squared). The exercises at the end of this chapter give you a chance to explore other waveforms and other harmonic structures. Aliasing I have a confession. I chose the examples in the previous section carefully to avoid showing you something confusing. But now it's time to get confused. Figure shows the spectrum of a triangle wave at 1100 Hz, sampled at , frames per second. Again, the view on the right is scaled to show the harmonics. The harmonics of
