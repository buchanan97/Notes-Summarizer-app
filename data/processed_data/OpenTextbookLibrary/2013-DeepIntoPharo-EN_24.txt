also provide simple methods for dealing with whole directory trees. Looking at File System internals Looking at File System internals At that stage, you should be able to comfortably use File System to cover your need le handing. This section is about the internal components of File System. It goes over important implementation details, which will surely interest readers willing to have a new kind of le system, for example on a data base or a remote le system. File Reference File System Path Paths and lesystems are the lowest level of the File System API. A File Reference combines a path and a lesystem into a single object which provides a simpler protocol for working with les as we show in the previous section. References implement the path protocol with methods like ,parent and resolve: . File System A lesystem is an interface to access hierarchies of directories and les. "The lesystem," provided by the host operating system, is represented by Disk Store and its platform-speci c subclasses. However, the user should not access them directly but instead use File System as we showed previously. Other kinds of lesystems are also possible. The memory lesystem provides a RAM disk lesystem where all les are stored as Byte Arrays in the image. The zip lesystem represents the contents of a zip le. Each lesystem has its own working directory, which is used to resolve any relative paths that are passed to it. Some examples: fs : File System memory. fs working Directory Path: (Path 'plonk'). grif e : Path 'plonk' 'grif e'. nurp : Path 'nurp'. fs resolve: nurp. Path plonk nurp fs create Directory: (Path 'plonk'). " plonk created"
