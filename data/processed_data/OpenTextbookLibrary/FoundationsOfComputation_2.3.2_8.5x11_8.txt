values. If not, you ll nd a r igorous proof of the fact later in this chapter. . PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC There are other logical operators besides , , and . We will consider theconditional operator , , thebiconditional operator , , and the exclusive or operator , . These operators can be completely de ned by a truth table that shows their values for the four possible co mbinations of truth values of pandq. De nition . For any propositions pandq, we de ne the propositions p q, p q, andp qaccording to the truth table: pqp qp qp q falsefalsetruetruefalse falsetruetruefalsetrue truefalsefalsefalsetrue truetruetruetruefalse When these operators are used in expressions, in the absence of parentheses to indicate order of evaluation, we use the following preced ence rules: The exclusive or operator, , has the same precedence as . The conditional operator, , has lower precedence than , , , and , and is therefore evaluated after them. Finally, the biconditional operator, , has the lowest precedence and is therefore evaluated last. For example, the expression p q r p s is evaluated as if it were written ( p (q r)) (( p) s). In order to work e ectively with the logical operators, you n eed to know more about their meaning and how they relate to ordinary Engl ish expressions. The proposition p qis called an implication or aconditional . It is usually read as pimpliesq. In English, p qis often expressed as if p thenq. For example, if prepresents the proposition Bill Gates is poor and q represents the moon is made of green cheese, then p qcould be expressed in English as If Bill Gates
