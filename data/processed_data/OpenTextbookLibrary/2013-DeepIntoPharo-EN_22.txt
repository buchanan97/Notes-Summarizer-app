They are left deliberately fuzzy, and are only resolved to a concrete reference when some le operation is performed. Instead of a lesystem and path, locators are made up of an origin and a path. An origin is an abstract lesystem location, such as the user s home directory, the image le, or the VM executable. When it receives a message like is File , a locator will rst resolve its origin, then resolve its path against the origin. Locators make it possible to specify things like "an item named packagecache in the same directory as the image le" and have that speci cation remain valid even if the image is saved and moved to another directory, possibly on a different computer. locator
