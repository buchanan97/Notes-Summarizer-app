programmer's thinking: Among several algorithms that all solve the same problem, which is the most efficient under the given circumstances? How much time and space does it take? What data structures do we use? In contrast to large programs, small programs are usually deep, consisting of short, compact code many of whose statements are executed very often. Understanding a small program may also be difficult, at least initially, since the chain of thought is often subtle. Once you understand it thoroughly, you can reproduce it at any time with much less effort than was first required. Mastery of interesting small programs is the Algorithms and Data Structures A Global Text . Algorithms and programs as literature: substance and form best way to get started in computer science. We encourage the reader to work out all the details of the examples we present. This book is concerned only with programming in the small. This decision determines our choice of topics to be presented, our style of presentation, and the notation we use to express programs, explanations, and proofs, and heavily influences our comments on techniques of programming. Our style of presentation appeals to the reader's intuition more t
