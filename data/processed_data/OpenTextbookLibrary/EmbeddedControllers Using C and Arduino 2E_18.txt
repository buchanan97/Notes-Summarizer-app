to print out the answer to the first program, we d wind up with something like Figure on the following page: It is worth noting that a large number of subgroups of code are collected together into what is referred to as the C standard library. The precise implementation of this is dependent on the operating system, however, the header files (e.g., stdio.h, string.h, math.h, etc.) remain distinct. Embedded Controllers Our fourth program include stdio.h void main( void ) float x ; float y ; float z; z x y (x y); printf( The answer is f n , z); Figure , a more complete program The f in the printf() function serves as a place holder for the variable z. If you need to print several values you can do something like this: printf( The answer from f and f is f n , x, y, z); In this case, the first f is used for x, the second f for y, and the final one for z. The result will look like: The answer from and is Some Simple Math C uses the same basic math operators as many other languages. These include , , (divide), and (multiply). Parentheses are used to group elements and force hierarchy of operations. C also includes for modulo. Modulo is an integer operation that leaves the remainder of a division, thus modulo is . The divide behaves a little differently with integers than with floats as there can be no remainder. Thus integer divide is , not as it would be if you were using floats. C also has a series of bit manipulators that we will look at a little later.
