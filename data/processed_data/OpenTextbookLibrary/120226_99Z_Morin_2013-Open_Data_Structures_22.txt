a reference (a pointer) to the newly-allocated memory block. This reference is small enough to be represented by a single word. The word-size wis a very important parameter of this model. The only assumption we will make about wis the lower-bound w logn, where n is the number of elements stored in any of our data structures. This is a fairly modest assumption, since otherwise a word is not even big enough to count the number of elements stored in the data structure. Space is measured in words, so that when we talk about the amount of space used by a data structure, we are referring to the number of words of memory used by the structure. All of our data structures store values of a generic type T, and we assume an element of type Toccupies one word of memory. (In reality, we are storing references to objects of type T, and these references occupy only one word of memory.) Thew-bit word-RAM model is a fairly close match for the ( -bit) Java Virtual Machine (JVM) when w . The data structures presented in this book don t use any special tricks that are not implementable on the JVM and most other architectures. Correctness, Time Complexity, and Space Complexity When studying the performance of a data structure, there are three things that matter most: Introduction Correctness: The data structure should correctly implement its interface. Time complexity: The running times of operations on the data structure should be as small as possible. Space complexity: The data structure should use as little memory as possible. In this introductory text, we will take correctness as a given; we won t consider data
