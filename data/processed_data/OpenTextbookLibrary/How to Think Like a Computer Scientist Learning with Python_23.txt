you have an idea what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis wa s correct, then you can predict the result of the modi cation, and you take a step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to com e up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes pointed out, When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. (A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four ) For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a program that does something and make small modi cations, debugging them as you go, so that you always have a working program. The way of the program For example, Linux is an operating system that contains thousands of lines of code, but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386 chip. According to Larry Green eld, One of Linus s earlier projects was a program that would switch between printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved to Linux. ( The Linux Users Guide Beta Version ) Later chapters will make more suggestions about debugging and other programming practices. Formal and natural languages Natural languages are the languages that people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally. Formal languages are languages that are designed by people for speci c applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use
