nearly invisible applications that surround us every day. Examples include the code that runs your microwave oven, automobile engine management system, cell phone, and many others. In terms of total units, embedded applications far outnumber desktop applications. You may have one or even a few PCs in your house but you probably use dozens of embedded applications every day. Embedded microcontrollers tend to be much less powerful but also much less expensive than their PC counterparts. The differing programming techniques are an integral part of this course and we shall spend considerable time examining them. How does C compare with Python? If, like many students taking this course, your background is with the Python language, you may find certain aspects of C a little odd at first. Some of it may seem overly complicated. Do not be alarmed though. The core of the language is actually simple. Python tends to hide things from the programmer while C doesn t. Initially, this seems to make things more complicated, and it does for the most simple of programs, but for more complicated tasks C tends to cut to the heart of the matter. Many kinds of data and hardware manipulation are much more direct and efficient in C than in other languages. One practical consideration is that C is a compiled language while most versions of Python are essentially interpreted. This means that there is an extra step in the development cycle, but the resulting compiled program is much more efficient. We will examine why this is so a little later. How does C compare with assembly language? Assembly has traditionally been used when code space and speed are of utmost importance.
