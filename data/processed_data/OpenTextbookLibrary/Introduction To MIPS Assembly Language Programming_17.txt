to decimal put the 2n value of each bit over the bits in the binary number and add the values which are , as in the example below: 1001010 Chapter . Converting Decimal to Binary using Binary Powers Two ways to convert decimal number to binary numbers are presented here. The first is easy to explain, but harder to implement . The second is a cleaner algorithm, but why the algorithm works is less intuitive. The first way to convert a number from decimal to binary is to see if a power of is present in the number. For example, consider the number . We know that there is no ( ) value in , but there is one value of (or ). So in the 9th digit of the base number we would put a , and subtract that from the value of . - Next check if there is a ( ) value in the number. There is, so add that bit to our string and subtract from the result. - - - - - - - - INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING - Now check for values of ( ). Since , put a zero in the position and continue. - Continuing this process for ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), and ( ) results in the final answer. Thus 110110001 . This result can be checked by converting the base number back to base . Chapter . Converting Decimal to Binary using Division While conceptually easy to understand, the method to convert decimal numbers to binary numbers in Chapter is not e asy to implement as the starting and stopping
