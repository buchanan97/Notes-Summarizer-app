paid higher than women in our country, even for the same jobs. What do we do with that realization? Is it okay? Do we want to try and fix it, and if so, how? With laws? Education? Government subsidies? Revolution? You ll remember my definition of Data Science on p. : deriving knowledgefromdata. This implies that the wisdom level of the hierarchy is really outside the discipline, and belongs to other disciplines instead. And that s partially true: in some sense, the data scientist s job stops when the deep truths about the real world are ferreted out and illustrated, leaving it to CEOs, directors, and other policy makers to act on them. But the data scientist is often involved here too, for a simple reason: a decision maker wants to know what s likely tohappenif a particular policy is implemented. Most non-trivial interventions will have results that are hard to predict in advance, as well as unintended side effects. One set of tools in the data scientist s toolkit is for making principled, calculated predictions about such things, as well as quantifying the level of uncertaintyin the predictions. Sometimes, the technique ofsimulationis used carrying out experiments on virtual societies or systems to see the likely aggregate effects of different interventions. It s like having a high-dimensional, multi-faceted crystal ball that lets you play out various scenarios to their logical conclusions. Starting with the rough and tumble real world and helping produce wise decisions about how humankind can deal with it all: that s the grand promise of the data science enterprise. And those are the mighty waters you re about to dip your toes in! I hope you ll
