time. The challenge now was to prove it. Only an ironclad proof would demonstrate, in a way that no computer ever could, that sync was inevitable; and the best kind of proof would clarify why it was inevitable. Strogatz is a mathematician, so his enthusiasm for proofs is understandable, but his proof doesn't address what is, to me, the most interesting part of the phenomenon. In order to prove that sync was inevitable", Strogatz makes several simplifying assumptions, in particular that each re y can see all the others. Chapter Complexity Science In my opinion, it is more interesting to explain how an entire valley of re ies can synchronize despite the fact that they cannot all see each other . How this kind of global behavior emerges from local interactions is the subject of Chapter . Explanations of these phenomena often use agent-based models, which explore (in ways that would be di cult or impossible with mathematical analysis) the conditions that allow or prevent synchronization. I am a computer scientist, so my enthusiasm for computational models is probably no surprise. I don't mean to say that Strogatz is wrong, but rather that people have di erent opinions about what questions to ask and what tools to use to answer them. These opinions are based on value judgments, so there is no reason to expect agreement. Nevertheless, there is rough consensus among scientists about which models are considered good science, and which others are fringe science, pseudoscience, or not science at all. A central thesis of this book is that the criteria this consensus is based on change over time, and that the emergence of complexity science re ects a
