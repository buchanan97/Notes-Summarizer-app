Controllers compiler can do type checking, it must know something about this new function. We tell the compiler to look into a special file called a header file to find this information. Every library will have an associated header file (usually of the same name) and it will normally end with a .h file extension3. The compiler directive is called an include statement. Our third program, this is an example of a single line comment include stdio.h void main( void ) printf( Hello world. n ); Figure , program with library function call This program simply prints the message Hello world. to the screen. The backslash-n combo is a special formatting token that means add a new line (i.e., bring the cursor to the line below). If we did not add the include directive, the compiler wouldn t know anything about printf(), and would complain when we tried to use it. So, what s in a header file? Well, among other things they contain function prototypes. The prototypes are nothing more than a template. You can create your own by cutting and pasting your function name with argument list and adding a semicolon to it. Here is the function prototype for our earlier math function: float add mult div( float a, float b ); You could make your own library of functions if you want. To use them, all you d need is an appropriate include statement in your code, and remember to add in your library code with the linker. This will allow you to reuse code and save time. We will look at multiple file projects and more on libraries in a later segment. Consequently, if we want
