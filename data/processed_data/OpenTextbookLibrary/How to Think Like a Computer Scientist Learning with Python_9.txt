in which Python handles variables. In C a variable is a name for a place that holds a thing. Variables have to be declared with types at least in part because the size of the place to which they refer needs to be predetermined. Thus, the idea of a variable is bound up with the hardware of the machine. The powerful and fundamental concept of a variable is already di cult enough for beginning students (in both computer science and algebra). Bytes and addresses do not help the matter. In Python a variable is a name that refers to a thing. This is a fa r more intuitive concept for beginning students and is much closer to the meaning of variable that they learned in their math courses. I had much less di culty teaching variables this year than I did in the past, and I spent less time helping students with problems using them. Another example of how Python aids in the teaching and learning of programming is in its syntax for functions. My students have always had a great deal of di culty understanding functions. The main problem centers around the di erence between a function de nition and a function call, and the related distinction between a parameter and an argument. Python comes to the rescue with syntax that is nothing short of beautiful. Function de nitions begin with the keyword def, so I simply tell my students, When you de ne a function, begin with def, followed by the name of the function that you are de ning; when you call a function, simply xi call (type) out its name. Parameters go with de nitions; arguments
