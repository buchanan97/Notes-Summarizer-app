The organization of the book follows the process I use when I start working with a dataset: Importing and cleaning: Whatever format the data is in, it usually takes some time and e ort to read the data, clean and transform it, and check that everything made it through the translation process intact. Single variable explorations: I usually start by examining one variable at a time, nding out what the variables mean, looking at distributions of the values, and choosing appropriate summary statistics. Pair-wise explorations: To identify possible relationships between variables, I look at tables and scatter plots, and compute correlations and linear ts. Multivariate analysis: If there are apparent relationships between variables, I use multiple regression to add control variables and investigate more complex relationships. Estimation and hypothesis testing: When reporting statistical results, it is important to answer three questions: How big is the e ect? How much variability should we expect if we run the same measurement again? Is it possible that the apparent e ect is due to chance? Visualization: During exploration, visualization is an important tool
