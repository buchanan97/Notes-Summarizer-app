fewer know of a nybble , or bits. bits in binary can represent numbers between .. , or values. So values of bits are collected together and create a base nu mber , called a hexadecimal (or simply hex ) number. To do this, digits are needed, and arbitrarily the numbers and letters , , , , , , , , , , A, B, C, D, E, and F were chosen as the digits. The binary numbers corresponding to these digit hex numbers are given in the table below (note, the normal way to indicate a value is in hex is to write a 0x before it So decimal would be 0x A) .

Note that hex numbers are normally only used to represent groupings of binary digits . Regardless of what the underlying binary valu es represent, hex will be used just to show what the binary digits are. So in this text all hex values will be unsigned whole numbers. Most students recognize that a decimal number can be extended by adding a to the left of a decimal number,
