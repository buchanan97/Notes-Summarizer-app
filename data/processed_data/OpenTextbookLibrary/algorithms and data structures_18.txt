frame program because its real purpose is to facilitate development and testing of new procedures by embedding them in a ready-made, tested environment. A simple frame program like the one below makes it very easy for a novice to write his first interactive graphics program. This particular frame program contains procedures 'Get Point', 'Draw Point', 'Click Point', 'Draw Line', 'Drag Line', 'Draw Circle', and 'Drag Circle' for input and display of points, lines, and circles on a screen idealized as a part of a Euclidean plane, disregarding the discretization due to the raster screen. Some of these procedures are so short that one asks why they are introduced at all. 'Get Point', for example, only converts integer mouse coordinates v, h into a point p with real coordinates. It enables us to refer to a point p without mentioning its coordinates explicitly. Thus, by bringing us closer to standard geometric notation, 'Get Point' makes programs more readable. The procedure 'Drag Line', on the other hand, is a very useful routine for interactive input of line segments. It uses the rubber-band technique , which is familiar to users of graphics editors. The user presses the mouse button to fix the first endpoint of a line segment, and keeps it depressed while moving the mouse to the desired second endpoint. At all times during this motion the program keeps displaying the line segment as it would look if the button were released at that moment. This rubber band keeps getting drawn and erased as it moves across other objects on the screen. The user should study a key detail in the procedure 'Drag Line' that prevents other objects from being erased or
