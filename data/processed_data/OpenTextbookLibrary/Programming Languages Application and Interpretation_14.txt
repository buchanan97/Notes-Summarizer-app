in some languages, complex numbers; and so on. After the numbers have been chosen, addition may support only some combinations of them. In addition, some languages permit the addition of datatypes such as matrices. Furthermore, many languages support addition of strings (we use scare-quotes because we don t really mean the mathematical concept of addition, but rather the operation performed by an operator with the syntax ). In some languages this always means concatenation; in some others, it can result in numeric results (or numbers stored in strings). These are all different meanings for addition. Semantics is the mapping of syntax (e.g., ) to meaning (e.g., some or all of the above). This brings us to our rst game of: Which of these is the same? Now return to the question above. What semantics do we have? We ve adopted whatever semantics Racket provides, because we map to Racket s . In fact that s not even quite true: Racket may, for all we know, also enable to apply to strings, so we ve chosen the restriction of Racket s semantics to numbers (though in fact Racket s doesn t tolerate strings). If we wanted a different semantics, we d have to implement it explicitly. Exercise What all would you have to change so that the number had signed- -bit arithmetic? In general, we have to be careful about too readily borrowing from the host language. We ll return to this topic later REF . Growing the Language We ve picked a very restricted rst language, so there are many ways we can grow it. Some, such as representing data structures and functions, will clearly force us to add new
