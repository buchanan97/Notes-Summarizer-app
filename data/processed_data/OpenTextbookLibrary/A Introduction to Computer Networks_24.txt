datagram forwarding. (That said, it arguably still isdatagram forwarding if web traf c to TCP port is forwarded differently than all other traf c, because that rule does not depend on the speci c connection.) Datagram forwarding is sometimes allowed to use other information beyond the destination address. In theory, IP routing can be done based on the destination address and some quality-of-service information, Datagram Forwarding An Introduction to Computer Networks, Release allowing, for example, different routing to the same destination for high-bandwidth bulk traf c and for lowlatency real-time traf c. In practice, most Internet Service Providers (ISPs) ignore user-provided qualityof-service information in the IP header, except by prearranged agreement, and route only based on the destination. By convention, switching devices acting at the LAN layer and forwarding packets based on the LAN address are called switches (or, originally, bridges; some still prefer that term), while such devices acting at the IP layer and forwarding on the IP address are called routers . Datagram forwarding is used both by Ethernet switches and by IP routers, though the destinations in Ethernet forwarding tables are individual nodes while the destinations in IP routers are entire networks (that is, sets of nodes). In IP routers within end-user sites it is common for a forwarding table to include a catchall default entry, matching any IP address that is nonlocal and so needs to be routed out into the Internet at large. Unlike the consolidated entries for B, D and E in the table above for S1, which likely would have to be implemented as actual separate entries, a default entry is a single record representing where to forward the packet if no other
