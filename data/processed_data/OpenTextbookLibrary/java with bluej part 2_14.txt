And for each row the data is presented in column order. There are rows of data in the table. . Note how values are separated by commas and the data for each row is enclosed in a pair of curly braces, fg. Each row contains values, one per month. . Only the snowfall amounts are in the array. A program must know the year that a row represents and know the month that a column represents. When the JVM creates the array, it actually creates an array where each element is an array. The diagram in Figure shows how the JVM organizes a two dimensional array in memory as an array of arrays. Figure : Two dimensional array - an array of arrays. When a program references an array element the JVM accesses the stor30 CHAPTER . ARRAYS OF ARRAYS age structure using the subscripts in sequence. So for snowfall the JVM uses the rst subscript, , to access the sixth element of the element array; then the JVM uses the second subscript, , to access the second element of a -element array where the value is stored in the above gure. In the foregoing we initialized the array in a declaration statement. That is not
