53a b Figure : Memory diagram of the variablesaandb. Diagrams like this one that show the state of the program are calledmemory diagrams. Each variable is represented with a box showing the name of the variable on the outside and its current value inside. As the program runs, the state of memory changes, so memory diagrams show only a particular point in time. For example, if we added the lineint c ; to the previous example, the memory diagram would look like Figure . 53a b 0c Figure : Memory diagram of the variablesa,b, andc. Printing Variables Printing Variables You can display the current value of a variable by usingprintorprintln. The following statements declare a variable namedfirst Line, assign it the value"Hello, again!", and display that value: String first Line "Hello, again!"; System.out.println(first Line); When we talk about displaying a variable, we generally mean thevalueof the variable. To display thenameof a variable, you have to put it in quotes: System.out.print("The value of first Line is "); System.out.println(first Line); For this example, the output is as follows: The value of first Line is Hello, again! Conveniently, the code for displaying a variable is the same regardless of its type. For example: int hour ; int minute ; System.out.print("The current time is "); System.out.print(hour); System.out.print(":"); System.out.print(minute); System.out.println("."); The output of this program is shown here: The current time is : . To output multiple values on the same line, it s common to use severalprint statements followed byprintlnat the end. But don t forget theprintln! On many computers, the output fromprintis stored without being displayed untilprintlnis run; then the entire line is displayed at once. If you omit the println, the program
