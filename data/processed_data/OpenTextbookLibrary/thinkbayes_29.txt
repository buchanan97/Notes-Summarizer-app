It gets the probabilit y for the giv en h yp othesis and m ultiplies b y the giv en lik eliho o d. After this up date, the distribution is no longer normalized, but b ecause these h yp otheses are m utually exclusiv e and collectiv ely exhaustiv e, w e can renormalize : pmf.Normalize() The result is a distribution that con tains the p osterior probabilit y for eac h h yp othesis, whic h is called (w ait no w) the p osterior distribution . Finally , w e can get the p osterior probabilit y for Bo wl : print pmf.Prob( ' Bowl ' ) And the answ er is . Y ou can do wnload this example from http: thinkbayes.com cookie.py .
