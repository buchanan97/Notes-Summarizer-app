look like numbers, so the following are illegal: 'chinese '-'food ' ' eggs ' 'easy ' ' third ' 'a charm ' But there are two exceptions, and . The operator performs string concatenation , which means it joins the strings by linking them end-to-end. For example: first 'throat ' second 'warbler ' first second throatwarbler The operator also works on strings; it performs repetition. For example, 'Spam ' 3is 'Spam Spam Spam '. If one of the values is a string, the other has to be an integer. This use of and makes sense by analogy with addition and multiplication. Just as is equivalent to , we expect 'Spam ' 3to be the same as 'Spam ' 'Spam ' 'Spam ', and it is. On the other hand, there is a signi cant way in which string concatenation and repetition are different from integer addition and multiplication. Can you think of a property that addition has that string concatenation does not? Comments As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more dif cult to read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often dif cult to look at a piece of code and gure out what it is doing, or why. . Debugging For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is doing. These notes are called comments , and they start with the symbol: compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed percentage (minute ) In this case, the comment appears on a line by itself. You can also put comments at the end of a line: percentage (minute ) percentage of
