number of mobile phones that are in use today. More and more of these mobile phones will be connected to the Internet. Furthermore, thanks to the availability of TCP IP implementations requiring limited resources such as u IP Dunkels2003 , we can expect to see a growth of TCP IP enabled embedded devices. Figure : Estimation of the number of mobile phones Before looking at the services provided by computer networks, it is useful to agree on some terminology that is widely used in networking literature. First of all, computer networks are often classi ed in function of the geographical area that they cover LAN : a local area network typically interconnects hosts that are up to a few or maybe a few tens of kilometers apart. MAN : a metropolitan area network typically interconnects devices that are up to a few hundred kilometers apart WAN : a wide area network interconnect hosts that can be located anywhere on Earth2 Another classi cation of computer networks is based on their physical topology. In the following gures, physical links are represented as lines while boxes show computers or other types of networking equipment. Computer networks are used to allow several hosts to exchange information between themselves. To allow any host to send messages to any other host in the network, the easiest solution is to organise them as a full-mesh, with a direct and dedicated link between each pair of hosts. Such a physical topology is sometimes used, especially when high performance and high redundancy is required for a small number of hosts. However, it has two major drawbacks : for a network containing nhosts, each host must have n-1physical interfaces.
