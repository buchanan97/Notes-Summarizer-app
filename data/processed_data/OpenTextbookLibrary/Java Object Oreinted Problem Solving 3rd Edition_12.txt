of computer programs (software), the CPU issues signals that control the other components that make up the computer system. One portion of the CPU, known as the arithmeticlogic unit (ALU) , performs all calculations, such as addition and subtraction, and all logical comparisons, such as when one piece of data is compared to another to determine if they are equal. There are two main types of software: Application software refers to programs designed to provide a particular task or service, such as word processors, computer games, spreadsheet programs, and Web browsers. System software includes programs that perform the basic operations that make a computer usable. For example, an important piece of system software is the operating system , which contains programs that manage the data stored on the computer s disks. An operating system assists application software in performing tasks that are considered primitive or low-level, such as managing the computer s memory and its input and output devices. Another important thing that the operating system does is to serve as an interface between the user and the hardware. The operating system determines how the user will interact with the system, or conversely, how the system will look and feel to the user. For example, in command-line systems, such as Unix and DOS (short for Disk Operating System), a program is run by typing its name on the command line. By contrast, in CHAPTER Computers, Objects, and Java graphically based systems, such as Windows and Macintosh, a program is run by clicking on its icon with the mouse. Thus, this point-and-click interface has a totally different look and feel but does the same thing. Special Topic: Processors Then and Now
