fruit banana baked Good nut bread print fruit baked Good The output of this program is banana nut bread . The space before the word nutis part of the string, and is necessary to produce the space between the concatenated strings. The operator also works on strings; it performs repetition. For example, Fun is Fun Fun Fun . One of the operands has to be a string; the other has to be an integer. Composition On one hand, this interpretation of and makes sense by analogy with addition and multiplication. Just as 3is equivalent to , we expect Fun to be the same as Fun Fun Fun , and it is. On the other hand, there is a signi cant way in which string concatenation and repetition are di erent from integer addition and multiplication. Can you think of a property that addition and multiplication have that string concatenation and repetition do not? Composition So far, we have looked at the ele
