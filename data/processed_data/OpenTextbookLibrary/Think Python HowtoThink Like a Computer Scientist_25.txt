statements in the Python interpreter and see what they do: x x Now put the same statements in a script and run it. What is the output? Modify the script by transforming each expression into a print statement and then run it again. Order of operations When an expression contains more than one operator, the order of evaluation depends on the order of operations . For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember the rules: Chapter . Variables, expressions and statements Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated rst, ( - ) is , and ( ) ( - ) is . You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute ) , even if it doesn t change the result. Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so is , not , and is , not . Multiplication and Division have higher precedence than Addition and Subtraction. So2 - is , not , and is , not . Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponentiation). So in the expression degrees pi , the division happens rst and the result is multiplied by pi. To divide by p, you can use parentheses or write degrees pi . I don t work very hard to remember the precedence of operators. If I can t tell by looking at the expression, I use parentheses to make it obvious. String operations In general, you can t perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings
