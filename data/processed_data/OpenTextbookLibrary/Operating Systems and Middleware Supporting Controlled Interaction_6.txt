The Oracle database system is used to illustrate deadlock detection and recovery as well as the use of atomic transactions. Messaging systems appear both as another application of atomic transactions and as an important form of communication middleware, supporting distributed applications. The speci c messaging examples are drawn from the IBM Web Sphere MQ system (formerly MQSeries) and the Java Message Service (JMS) interface, which is part of Java Enterprise Edition (J2 EE). The other communication middleware example is Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation). Organization of the Text Chapter provides an overview of the text as a whole, explaining what an operating system is, what middleware is, and what sorts of support these systems provide for controlled interaction. The next nine chapters work through the varieties of controlled interaction that are exempli ed by the scenario at the beginning of the preface: interaction between concurrent computations on the same system (as between your email program and your word processor), interaction across time (as between your word processor before your trip and your word processor after your trip), and interaction across space (as between your email program and your service provider's email server). The rst of these three topics is controlled interaction between computations operating at one time on a particular computer. Before such interaction can make sense, you need to understand how it is that a single computer can be running more than one program, such as an email program in one window and a word processing program in another. Therefore, Chapter explains the fundamental mechanism for dividing a computer's attention between concurrent computations, known as threads. Chapter continues with the related topic of scheduling. That is, if the computer
