go with ca lls. There are no return types, parameter types, or reference and value parameters to get in the way, so I am now able to teach functions in less than half the time that it previously took me, with better comprehension. Using Python has improved the e ectiveness of our computer science program for all students. I see a higher general level of success and a lower level of frustration than I experienced during the two years I taught C . I move faster with better results. More students leave the course with the ability to create meaningful programs and with the positive attitude toward the experience of programm ing that this engenders. Building a community I have received email from all over the globe from people using this book to lea rn or to teach programming. A user community has begun to emerge, and many people have been contributing to the project by sending in materials for the companion website at http: www.thinkpython.com . With the publication of the book in print form, I expect the growth in the user community to continue and accelerate. The emergence of this user community and the possibility it suggests for similar collaboration among educators have been the most exciting parts of working on this project for me. By working together, we can increase the quality of materials available for our use and save valuabl e time. I invite you to join our community and look forward to hearing from you.
