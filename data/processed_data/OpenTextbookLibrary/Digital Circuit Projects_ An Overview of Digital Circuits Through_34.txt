is left as an exercise. Don t care conditions Sometimes when specifying an equation there are a number of situations where the input is not used. If the input is not used, then any value ( or ) can be used, and these are called don t care conditions . For example, cons ider a -segment display which is used for many time clocks for sporting events. The display consists of segments that are used to display the decimal numbers .. . A - segment display along with the names for each segment (A..G ) is shown below. Each digit - will lights or more segments to create the number. For example the digit would light segments A,B,C,D,E,F; the number would light segments B,C; the number would light segments A,B,D,E,G; etc. Therefore, there will be Boolean functions, one for each segment. Next, knowing that digits can be represented using a minimum of bits, a truth table can be created where the input digits represent the decimal number, and a truth table developed for each of the segments making up the number. When doing this, note that input values for the truth table must always be between - , so there are values ( - ) that are not used, so those rows in the table are never accessed. The values for the segments for thos e rows are don t cares because they are never used; the component does not use those values, so it does not care how they are set. This gives the result for the -segment display truth table, where X don t care, which is shown below. Input Output A B C D A B C
