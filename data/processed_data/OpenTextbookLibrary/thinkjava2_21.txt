ends with a semicolon (;). Variablenamesusuallybeginwithalowercaseletter, incontrasttoclassnames (like Hello) that start with a capital letter. When a variable name contains more than one word (likefirst Name), it is conventional to capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. Variable names are case-sensitive, so first Nameis not the same asfirstnameor First Name. You can use any name you want for a variable. But there are about reserved words, calledkeywords, that you are not allowed to use as variable names. These words includepublic,class,static,void, andint, which are used by the compiler to analyze the structure of the program. You can see the full list of keywords (https: thinkjava.org keywords), but you don t have to memorize them. Most programming editors provide syntax highlighting , which makes different parts of the program appear in different colors. And the compiler will complain even if one does sneak past you and your editor. Assigning Variables Now that we have declared some variables, we can use them to store values. We do that with anassignmentstatement: Memory Diagrams message "Hello!"; give message the value "Hello!" hour ; assign the value to hour minute ; set minute to This example shows three assignments, and the comments illustrate different ways people sometimes talk about assignment statements. The vocabulary can be confusing here, but the idea is straightforward: When you declare a variable, you create a named storage location. When you make an assignment to a variable, you update its value. As a general rule, a variable has to have the same type as the value you assign to it. For example, you cannot store a string inminuteor an integer in message. We will show some examples that seem to break
