full Name and assign it a value is to use the new operator: String full Name new String ("Joe Smith" ); In general, the new operator is used to instantiate (to cr eate) an object. new operator Because text strings are so common Java provides the short cut for allocating a string, such as: String full Name "Joe Smith" ; The only way to work with objects is through the methods that are defined in the class from which the object is instantiated. The String class provides many methods for working with text strings such as: Useful String methods method name type description char At( ) char returns the character at a specified position (provided as the argument) where position is one of , , , up to the length of the string. equals( ) boolean used to determine if two strings are identical equals Ignore Case( ) boolean used to determine if two strings are identical irrespective of case index Of( ) int returns th e first position of a character provided as an argument, or - if it is not present length() int returns the length of a string to Lower Case() String converts all characters to lower case to Upper Case() String converts all characters to upper case trim() String removes leading spaces (blanks) and trailing spaces from a string Table : Some of the useful String methods At some time you should view the official documentation for the String class. Perhaps you will do this whe n you are developing a program and you want to look up the String methods . If you are using Blue J it is very easy to see the documentation
