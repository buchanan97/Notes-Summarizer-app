coherent program to solve a brand-new problem. We teach programming much like we teach writing. We start reading and explaining programs, then we write simple programs, and then we write increasingly complex programs over time. At some point you get your muse and see the patterns on your own and can see more naturally how to take a problem and write a program that solves that problem. And once you get to that point, programming becomes a very pleasant and creative process. We start with the vocabulary and structure of Python programs. Be patient a s the simple examples remind you of when you started reading for the rst time. Words and sentences Unlike human languages, the Python vocabulary is actually pretty small. We ca ll this vocabulary the reserved words or keywords . These are words that hav e very special meaning to Python. When Python sees these words in a Python program, they have one and only one meaning to Python. Later as you write programs you will make up your own words that have meaning to you called variables . You will have great latitude in choosing your names for your variables, but you cannot use any of Python s reserved words as a name for a variable.
