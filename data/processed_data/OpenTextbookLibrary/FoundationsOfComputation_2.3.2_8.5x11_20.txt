important is the Second Substitution Law, which says that yo u can substitute an expression for a logically equivalent expression, where ver it occurs. Once again, we will accept this as a theorem without trying to prov e it here. It is surprisingly hard to put this law into words: Theorem (Second Substitution Law) .Suppose that Pand Qare any propositions such that P Q. Suppose that Ris any compound proposition in which (P)occurs as a subproposition. Let R be the proposition that is obtained by substituting (Q)for that occurrence of (P)in R. Then R R . Note that in this case, the theorem does not require ( Q) to be substituted foreveryoccurrence of ( P) in R. You are free to substitute for one, two, or as many occurrences of ( P) as you like, and the result is still logically equivalent to R. The Second Substitution Lawallowsustousethelogicalequi valence ( p) pto simplify the expression q ( ( p)) by substituting ( p) for ( ( p)). The resulting expression, q (p), or just q pwithout the parentheses, is logically equivalent to the original q ( ( p)). Once again, we have to be careful about parentheses: The fact that p p pdoesnotallow us to rewrite q p p ras I ve added parentheses around Qhere for technical reasons. Sometimes, the parentheses are necessary to make sure that Qis evaluated as a whole, so that its nal value is used in place ofp. As an example of what can go wrong, consider q r. If this is substituted literally for p in ( p), without parentheses, the result is ( q r). But this expression means (( q) r), which
