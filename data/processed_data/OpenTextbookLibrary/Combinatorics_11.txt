there must be some ibetween 1andcsuch that there is a complete subgraph on ni vertices, all of whose edges are coloured with colour i. In addition to requiring some graph theory, that statement was a bit technical. In much less precise terms that don t require so much background knowledge (but could be misleading in specific situations), Ramsey theory asserts that if a structure is big enough and contains a property we are interested in, then no matter how we cut it into (a limited number of) pieces, at least one of the pieces should also have that property. One major theorem in Ramsey theory is van der Waerden s Theorem, which states that for any two constants candn, there is a constant V(c,n)such that if we take V(c,n)consecutive numbers and colour them with ccolours, there must be an arithmetic progression of length nall of whose members have been coloured with the same colour. EXAMPLE . Here is a small example of van der Waerden s Theorem. With two colours and a desired length of 3for the arithmetic progression, we can show that V( , ) 8using the following colouring: (In case it is di icult to see, we point out that , , , and 8are black, while , , , and are grey, a different colour.) Notice that with eight consecutive integers, the difference in a three-term arithmetic progression cannot be larger than three. For every three-term arithmetic progression with difference of one, two, or three, it is straightforward to check that the numbers have not all received the same colour. In fact,V( , ) , but proving this requires exhaustive testing. . What is Combinatorics? We will
