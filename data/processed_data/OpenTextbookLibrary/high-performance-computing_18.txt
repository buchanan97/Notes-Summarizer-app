the average memory performance would be: ( ) ( ) ( ) ns You can easily see why it s important to have an L1 cache hit rate of or higher . Given that a cache holds only a subset of the main memory at any time, it s important to keep an index of which areas of the main memory are currently stored in the cache. T o reduce the amount of space that must be dedicated to tracking which memory areas are in cache, the cache is divided into a number of equal sized slots known as lines . Each line contains some number of sequential main memory locations, generally four to sixteen integers or real numbers. Whereas the data within a line comes from the same part of memory , other lines can contain data that is far separated within your program, or perhaps data from somebody else s program, as in link . When you ask for something from memory , the computer checks to see if the data is available within one of these cache lines. If it is, the data is returned with a minimal delay . If it s not, your program may be delayed while a new line is fetched from main memory . Of course, if a new line is brought in, another has to be thrown out. If you re lucky , it won t be the one containing the data you are just about to need. Cache lines can come from dif ferent parts of memory On multiprocessors (computers with several CPUs), written data must be returned to main memory so the rest of the processors can see it,
