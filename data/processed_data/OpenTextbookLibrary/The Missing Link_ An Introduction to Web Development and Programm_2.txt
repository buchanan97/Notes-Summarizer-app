a single resource that integrates good design practices, modern technologies, and all of the programming tools that one would need to build a successful, dynamic web site. Unlike many texts, this one begins by giving the readers a solid foundation in the tech - nology that runs the Internet along with a sense of what technology is currently coming of age. This is followed by both a process and pattern-oriented slant on web design that fo - cuses on the Model-View-Controller structure which underlies the rest of the text. HTML and CSS covered for the development of web interfaces. The PHP and Java Script sections enable readers to develop the controllers for those interfaces. Finally, a concise introduction to databases and SQL allows for the development of robust data models. In addition to the unique combination of content found in this book, the tone is also one of practicality. The author doesn t mince words and gets right to the point with ex - amples meant to be referenced quickly and often. Although this directness may put off some readers who prefer to read texts cover to cover, all software developers know that this is how texts are used in the real world. In the end, the broad approach that The Missing Link takes to web design and pro - gramming combined with the text s concise presentation of information makes this a web programming text unlike any other.
