following expressions: - - Numeric Data Types: float , double These data types are used to represent values that have decimal places. For example, the numbers , , - , and are written with decimal places. Even zero written as is a double . The float and double types differ with respect to the number of significant digits they store (approximately for float and for double) and the overall magnitude of a value that can be represented. The table below shows the amount of memory used and the maximum value per type: data type memory maximum float bytes 1038 double bytes 10308 Of course a programmer can perform calculations on double s and float s. The operators we will discuss at this time include , -, , and as shown in the following table. operator example of use example s result - - Listing illustrates some simple double calculations in order to compute and display fuel consump tion as litres per kilometres travelled. Listing : Perform simple double calculations public class Fuel Consumption public static void main(String args) Calculate fuel consumption as litres per kilo metres travelled. All calculations involve doubles. double litres, km, km100; litres ; km ; km100 km ; calculate litres per 100km double consumption litres k m100; System.out.println(consumption); Doubles as approximations Not every number can be represented exactly as a double or float . You know that some fractions cannot be written, using decimals, exactly or completely. Most people u se the decimal number system where we can write out the fraction exactly as . However, the fraction is a repeating decimal. If we write it out as a decimal number we either stop at some
