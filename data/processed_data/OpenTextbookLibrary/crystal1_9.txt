You can type plain-ol text in a Markdown cell, plus various cutesy formatting adornments like boldface (putting double-splats ( ) around a word or phrase), italics (single splats), outline headings (prefacing a line with one or more hashtags (like or ), and so forth. When you type in a Markdown cell, you see the raw text and formatting; to actually get Jupyter torenderyour cells and make them pretty, you choose Run All from the Cell menu. Code.The most important cells are Code cells which contain (duh) code. When executed (again, by choosing Run All from the Cell menu) they actually carry out the Python instructions you have typed in that cell, and display any results. By the way, a common snafu is to somehow accidentally click in a way that changes the type of a cell from Code to one of the other types. If you do this, the Python code in that cell won t execute until you change the type back to Code (more on this below). Figure shows a Jupyter Notebook hosted by the Co Calccloud computing platform, which we ll use this semester. It has two cells, one Markdown and one Code. Note carefully thecell-type dropdownwhichiskindofhiddeninthemiddleofthepage: itcurrently reads Code because the second cell is the one that s highlighted. (If we clicked to highlight and edit the top cell, that dropdown would change to Markdown. ) The top figure shows the two cells before the user has done a Run All from the Cell menu: all the Markdown is unrendered (see the
