Actors and Actions Improving a business process requires first understanding the process. Diagramming the steps in the process contributes greatly to that understanding. Business process diagrams typically consist of actions linked by arrows. However, it is also important to be clear about who is performing each action. For this reason we create a swim lane for each actor in the process. The actors pass a metaphorical baton among themselves at different stages of the process. An easy way to diagram a business process is to first ident ify all of the actors and place each in a swim lane. The process begins at the top of the page and continues down the page following the arrows. Arrows represent communication among the actors, while diamonds represent decision points. While actors are normally people, a computer standing in for the role of a person can also be an actor. At times we can simplify the business process diagram by eliminating all but the essential elements. This makes the diagram less cluttered and easier to read. On the facing page we have a process diagram reduced to just three elements swim lanes, actions, and arrows. For the level of analysis needed in this course, the simplified diagram is more than sufficient. However, it is good to know the full lexicon, especially the decision point diamond shown on the next page.
