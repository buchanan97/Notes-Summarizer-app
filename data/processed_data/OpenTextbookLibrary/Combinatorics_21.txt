total, the product rule tells us that there are possible combinations for the results of the third and fourth flips. This will be the denominator of the probability. To determine the numerator (that is, the number of ways in which both flips can result in heads), we again consider each flip as a different aspect. There is only one possible way for the third flip to be heads, and then there is only one possible way for the fourth flip to be heads. So in total, only one of the four possible combinations of outcomes involves both coins landing as heads. The probability that Iswar s next two flips will also result in heads is . Notice that in this example, the fact that Iswar s first two flips were heads was irrelevant to our calculations, because it was already a known outcome, over and done with, so is true no matter what may happen with his later flips. If Iswar hadn t yet flipped the coin and we asked for the probability that his first four flips will all be heads, then our calculations would have to include both possible options for the outcome of each of his first two flips. In this case, the final probability would be (there are 16possible combinations for the outcomes of four coin flips, only one of which involves all four being heads). EXERCISES .
