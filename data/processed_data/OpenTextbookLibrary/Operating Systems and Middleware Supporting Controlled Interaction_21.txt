centered around controlled interaction. Like an operating system, middleware may enforce rules designed to keep the computations from interfering with one another. An example is the rule that only one computation may modify a shared data structure at a time. Like an operating system, middleware may bring computations at di erent times into contact through persistent storage and may support interaction between computations on di erent computers by providing network communication services. Operating systems and middleware are not the same, however. They rely upon di erent underlying providers of lower-level services. An operating system provides the services in its API by making use of the features supported by the hardware. For example, it might provide API services of reading and writing named, variable-length les by making use of a disk drive's ability to read and write numbered, xed-length blocks of data. Middleware, on the other hand, provides the services in its API by making use of the features supported by an underlying operating system. For example, the middleware might provide API services for updating relational database tables by making use of an operating system's ability to read and write les that contain the database. This layering of middleware on top of an operating system, as illustrated in Figure , explains the name; middleware is in the middle of the vertical . WHAT IS MIDDLEWARE? stack, between the application programs and the operating system. Viewed horizontally rather than vertically, middleware is also in the middle of interactions between di erent application programs (possibly even running on di erent computer systems), because it provides mechanisms to support controlled interaction through coordination, persistent storage, naming, and communication. I already mentioned relational database systems
