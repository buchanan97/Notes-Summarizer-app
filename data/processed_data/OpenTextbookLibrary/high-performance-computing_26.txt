other instructions, but what kind of interplay is there between instructions and data? It would seem possible for instructions to bump perfectly useful data from cache, or vice versa, with complete disregard for locality of reference. Many designs from the 1980s used a single cache for both instructions and data. But newer designs are employing what is known as the Harvar d Memory Ar chitectur e, where the demand for data is segregated from the demand for instructions. Main memory is a still a single lar ge pool, but these processors have separate data and instruction caches, possibly of dif ferent designs. By providing two independent sources for data and instructions, the aggregate rate of information coming from memory is increased, and interference between the two types of memory references is minimized. Also, instructions generally have an extremely high level of locality of reference because of the sequential nature of most programs. Because the instruction caches don t have to be particularly lar ge to be ef fective, a typical architecture is to have separate L1 caches for instructions and data and to have a combined L2 cache. For example, the IBM Motorola Power PC 604e has separate -K four -way set-associative L1 caches for instruction and data and a combined L2 cache. Virtual Memory Virtual memory decouples the addresses used by the program (virtual addresses) from the actual addresses where the data is stored in memory (physical addresses). Y our program sees its address space starting at and working its way up to some lar ge number , but the actual physical addresses assigned can be very dif ferent. It gives a degree of flexibility by allowing all processes
