temperature; an array of temperatures boolean answer; an array of true false answers char letter; an array of multiple choice answers The above are examples of how to declare an array. Before the array can be used the programmer must also declare its size. Once the programmer declares the size it cannot be made larger - this is one of the drawbacks to using arrays and why sometimes another technique will be chosen. To declare an array that can hold, say, names we use: String student Name; student Name new String ; or, we can combine the above into one line: String student Name new String ; or, if an intvariable holds the length we can write: int arraylength ; String student Name new String arraylength ; Every array has an int eld named length that is a part of it; the value stored is the length of the array. So, for student Name above the value stored instudent Name.length is . This eld is very useful; for instance if we need to display all the names in student Name we can use the code: for (int i ; i student Name . length ; i System . out. println ( student Name i ); The length eld is immutable which means it cannot be altered once it is set. This means that once you have declared an array to be a certain length you cannot change its length. . INITIALIZING ARRAYS Initializing arrays Because arrays can have multiple values there is a di erent syntax used when its necessary to set initial values. For instance, suppose we need an array to hold the number of days in each month.
