which yields . If these same operations had gone from right to left, the result would have been59 , which is incorrect. Anytime you want to override the order of operations (or you are not sure what it is) you can use parentheses. Expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, so( ) 3is . You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in(minute ) , even though it doesn t change the result. Compiler Error Messages See the official Java tutorials for a complete table of operator precedence (https: thinkjava.org operators). If the order of operations is not obvious when looking at an expression, you can always add parentheses to make it more clear. But over time, you should internalize these kinds of details about the Java language. Compiler Error Messages Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: compile-time errors, run-time errors, and logic errors. It is useful to distinguish among them in order to track them down more quickly. Compile-timeerrors occur when you violate the rules of the Java language. For example, parentheses and braces have to come in matching pairs. So ( )is legal, but8)is not. In the latter case, the program cannot be compiled, and the compiler displays a syntax error . Error messages from the compiler usually indicate where in the program the error occurred. Sometimes they can tell you exactly what the error is. As an example, let s get back to the Hello World program from Section : public class Hello public static void main(String args) generate some simple output System.out.println("Hello, World!"); If you forget the semicolon at the end of the print statement, you might get an
