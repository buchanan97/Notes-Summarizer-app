interacting with each other interdependently to generate patterns over a broad range of scales. Therefore, the behavior of complex systems often appears to contradict our everyday experiences. As illustrated in the examples above, it is extremely dif cult for us to come up with a reasonable model when we are facing something unfamiliar. And it is even more dif cult to come up with a reasonable set of microscopic rules that could explain the observed macroscopic properties of a system. Most of us are simply not experienced enough to make logical connections between things at multiple different scales. How can we improve our abilities to model complex systems? The answer might be as simple as this: We need to become experienced and familiar with various dynamics of complex systems to become a good modeler of them. How can we become experienced? This is a tricky question, but thanks to the availability of the computers around us,computational modeling andsimulation is becoming a reasonable, practical method for this purpose. Y ou can construct your own model with full details of microscopic rules coded into your computer, and then let it actually show the macroscopic behavior arising from those rules. Such computational modeling and simulation is a very powerful tool that allows you to gain interactive, intuitive (simulated) experiences of various possible dynamics that help you make mental connections between micro- and macroscopic scales. I would say there are virtually no better tools available for studying the dynamics of complex systems in general. There are a number of pre-built tools available for complex systems modeling and simulation, including Net Logo , Repast , MASON , Golly , and so on. Y ou could
