triggered several conversations which let to me becoming the author of the second edition. In true "open-source" fashion - since I complained about it - I got to fix it. During Fall 1997, while I was using the book to teach my HPC course, I re-wrote the book one chapter at a time, fueled by multiple latenight lattes and the fear of not having anything ready for the weeks lecture. The second edition came out in July 1998, and was pretty well received. I got many good comments from teachers and scientists who felt that the book did a good job of teaching the practitioner - which made me very happy . In 1998, this book was published at a crossroads in the history of High Performance Computing. In the late 1990's there was still a question a to whether the lar ge vector supercomputers with their specialized memory systems could resist the assault from the increasing clock rates of the microprocessors. Also in the later 1990's there was a question whether the fast, expensive, and power -hungry RISC architectures would win over the commodity Intel microprocessors and commodity memory technologies. By 2003, the market had decided that the commodity microprocessor was king - its performance and the performance of commodity memory subsystems kept increasing so rapidly . By 2006, the Intel architecture had eliminated all the RISC architecture processors by greatly increasing clock rate and truly winning the increasingly important Floating Point Operations per W att competition. Once users figured out how to ef fectively use loosely coupled processors, overall cost and improving ener gy consumption of commodity microprocessors became overriding factors in the market place. These changes led
