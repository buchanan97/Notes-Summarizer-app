For higher math operations, you will want to look at the math library (math.h header file). Some examples are sin(), cos(), tan(), log10() (common log) and pow() for powers and roots. Do not try to use as you do on many calculators. x raised to the y power is not x y but rather pow(x, y). The operator has an entirely different meaning in C! Recalling what we said earlier about libraries, if you wanted to use a function like sin() in your code, you d have to tell the compiler where to find the prototype and similar info. At the top of your program you d add the line: include math.h Embedded Controllers A final caution: The examples above are meant to be clear, but not necessarily the most efficient way of doing things. As we shall see, sometimes the way you code something can have a huge impact on its performance. Given the power of C, expert programmers can sometimes create code that is nearly indecipherable for ordinary people. There is a method behind the apparent madness. The program creation development cycle To create a C program: .Do the requisite mental work. This is the most important part. .Create the C source code. This can be done using a text editor, but is normally done within the IDE (Integrated Development Environment). C source files are plain text and saved with a .c extension. .Compile the source code. This creates an assembly output file. Normally, compiling automatically fires up the assembler, which turns the assembly file into a machine language output file. .Link the output file with any required libraries using the linker. This creates an executable file. For
