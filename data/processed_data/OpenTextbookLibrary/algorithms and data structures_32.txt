literature: substance and form Learning objectives: programming in the large versus programming in the small large flat programs versus small deep programs programs as literature fractal pictures: snowflakes and Hilbert's space-filling curve recursive definition of fractals by production or rewrite rules Pascal and programming notations Programming in the large versus programming in the small In studying and discussing the art of programming it is useful to distinguish between large programs and small programs, since these two types impose fundamentally different demands on the programmer. Programming in the large Large programs (e.g. operating systems, database systems, compilers, application packages) tax our organizational ability . The most important issues to be dealt with include requirements analysis, functional specification, compatibility with other systems, how to break a large program into modules of manageable size, documentation, adaptability to new systems and new requirements, how to organize the team of programmers, and how to test the software. These issues are the staple of software engineering. When compared to the daunting managerial and design challenges, the task of actual coding is relatively simple. Large programs are often flat: Most of the listing consists of comments, interface specifications, definitions, declarations, initializations, and a lot of code that is executed only rarely. Although the function of any single page of source code may be rather trivial when considered by itself, it is difficult to understand the entire program, as you need a lot of information to understand how this page relates to the whole. The classic book on programming in the large is Bro . Programming in the small Small programs, of the kind discussed in this book, challenge our technical know-how and inventiveness. Algorithmic issues dominate the
