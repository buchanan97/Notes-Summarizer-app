(A C)). The input wires to each logic gate are on the left, with the output wire on the right. Note that when wires cross each o ther in a diagram such as this, the wires don t actually intersect un less there is a black circle at the point where they cross. An OR gate is an electronic component with two inputs and one output which turns its output on if either (or both) of its inputs is o n. If the inputs are given names Aand B, then the orgate computes the logical value of A B. ANOT gate has one input and one output, and it turns its output o when the input is on and on when the input is o . If the input is named A, then the notgate computes the value of A. Other types of logic gates are, of course, possible. Gates co uld be made to compute A Bor A B, for example. However, any computation that can be performed by logic gates can be done using only and,or, andnotgates, as we willseebelow. (Inpractice, however, nandgatesand norgates, whichcompute the values of (A B) and (A B) respectively, are often used because they are easier to build from transistors than andandorgates.) The three types of logic gates are represented by standard sy mbols, as shown in Figure . Since the inputs and outputs of logic gates are just wires ca rrying on o signals, logic gates can be wired together by connecti ng outputs from some gates to inputs of other gates. The result is a logic circuit . An example is also shown in Figure . The logic circuit in the
