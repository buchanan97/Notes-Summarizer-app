code, and for developing new code. The test runner is a tool for running unit tests. It also supports Test Driven Development. Chapter A rst application In this chapter, we will develop a simple game: Quinto. Along the way we will demonstrate most of the tools that Squeak programmers use to construct and debug their programs, and show how programs are exchanged with other developers. We will see the system browser, the object inspector, the debugger and the Monticello package browser. Development in Smalltalk is ef cient: you will nd that you spend far more time actually writing code and far less managing the development process. This is partly because the Smalltalk language is very simple, and partly because the tools that make up the programming environment are very well integrated with the language. The Quinto game Figure : The Quinto game board. The user has just clicked the mouse as shown by the cursor. To show you how to use Squeak s programming tools, we will build a simple game called Quinto . The game board is shown in Figure ; it A rst application consists of rectangular array of light yellow cells. When you click on one of the cells with the mouse, the four surrounding cells turn blue. Click again, and they toggle back to light yellow. The object of the game is to turn blue as many cells as possible. The Quinto game shown in Figure is made up of two kinds of objects: the game board itself, and individual cell objects. The Squeak code to implement the game will contain two classes: one for the game and one for the cells. We will now show
