of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain exp erience, though, you will make fewer errors and nd them faster. What is debugging? Runtime errors The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until you run the program. These errors are also called exceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened. Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the rst f ew chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one. Semantic errors The third type of error is the semantic error . If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run successfully, in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Speci cally, it will do what you told it to do. The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you wanted to write. The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong. Identifying sema ntic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking a t the output of the program and trying to gure out what it is doing. Experimental debugging One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, a nd interesting parts of programming. In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues, and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see. Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once
