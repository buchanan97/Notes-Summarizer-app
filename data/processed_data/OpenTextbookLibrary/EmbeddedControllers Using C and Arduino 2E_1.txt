can get up and running fairly quickly. From there, the Arduino development environment is examined. Unlike the myriad Arduino books now available, this text does not simply rely on the Arduino libraries. As convenient as the libraries may be, there are other, sometimes far more efficient, ways of programming the boards. Many of the chapters examine library source code to see what s under the hood . This more generic approach means it will be easier for the student to use other processors and development systems instead of being tightly tied to one platform. All Atmel schematics and data tables are derived from the published version of the Atmel P documentation which may be found at https: www.microchip.com wwwproducts en ATMEGA328 P This serves as the final word on the operation and performance of the P and all interested parties should become familiar with it. There is a companion laboratory manual to accompany this text. Other OER (Open Educational Resource) laboratory manuals in this series include Computer Programming with Python, and Science of Sound. OER texts and laboratory manuals are available for Operational Amplifiers Linear Integrated Circuits, Semiconductor Devices, DC Electrical Circuit Analysis and AC Electrical Circuit Analysis. Please check my web sites for the latest versions. A Note from the Author This text was designed for our ABET accredited AAS program in Electrical Engineering Technology. Specifically, it is used in our second year embedded controllers course. I am indebted to my students, coworkers and the MVCC family for their support and encouragement of this project.
