An Overview of Networks An Introduction to Computer Networks, Release data dataheader header1header2 Fig. :: Packets with headers data. While there are proponents of very large packet sizes, larger even than k B, at the other extreme the ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) protocol uses bytes of data per packet, and there are good reasons for believing in modest packet sizes. One potential issue is how to forward packets from a large-packet LAN to (or through) a small-packet LAN; in later chapters we will look at how the IP (or Internet Protocol) layer addresses this. Generally each layer adds its own header. Ethernet headers are typically bytes, IP headers bytes, and TCP headers bytes. If a TCP connection sends bytes of data per packet, then the headers amount to of the total, a not-unreasonable overhead. For one common V oice-over-IP option, packets contain bytes of data and bytes of headers, making the header about of the total. Compressing the bytes of audio, however, may bring the data portion down to bytes, meaning that the headers are now of the total; see RTP and Vo IP . In datagram-forwarding networks the appropriate header will contain the address of the destination and perhaps other delivery information. Internal nodes of the network called routers orswitches will then try to ensure that the packet is delivered to the requested destination. The concept of packets and packet switching was rst introduced by Paul Baran in 1962 ( PB62 ). Baran s primary concern was with network survivability in the event of node failure; existing centrally switched protocols were vulnerable to central failure. In 1964, Donald Davies independently developed many of the same concepts; it was Davies
