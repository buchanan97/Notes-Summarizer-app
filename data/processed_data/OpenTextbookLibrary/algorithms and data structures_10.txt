in the programming language Logo, turtle graphics primitives are now available for several computer systems and languages. They come in different versions, but the essential point is the same as that introduced in the example of the robot car: The pen (or "turtle") is a device that has a state (position, direction) and is driven by incremental operations move and turn that transform the turtle to a new state depending on its current state: move(s) take s unit steps in the direction you are facing turn(d) turn counterclockwise d degrees The turtle's initial state is set by the following operations: moveto(x,y) move to the position (x,y) in absolute coordinates turnto(d) face d degrees from due east In addition, we can specify the color of the trail drawn by the moving pen: pencolor(c) where c white, black, none, etc. Example The following program fragment approximates a circle tangential to the x-axis at the origin by drawing a 36sided polygon: moveto( , ); position pen at origin turnto( ); face east step : ; arbitrarily chosen step length do times sides move(step); turn( ) degrees counterclockwise In graphics programming we are likely to use basic figures, such as circles, over and over again, each time with a different size and position. Thus we wish to turn a program fragment such as the circle approximation above into a reusable procedure. Algorithms and Data Structures A Global Text . Graphics primitives and environments Procedures as building blocks A program is built from components at many different levels of complexity. At the lowest level we have the constructs provided by the language we use: constants, variables, operators, expressions, and simple (unstructured) statements. At the next
