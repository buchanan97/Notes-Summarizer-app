rechnernetze-das-umfassendelehrbuch. Classroom Use This book is meant as a serious and more-or-less thorough text for an introductory college or graduate course in computer networks, carefully researched, with consistent notation and style, and complete with diagrams and exercises. I have also tried to rethink the explanations of many protocols and algorithms, with the goal of making them easier to understand. My intent is to create a text that covers to a reasonable extent whythe Internet is the way it is, to avoid the endless dreary focus on TLA s (Three-Letter Acronyms), and to remain nottoomathematical. For the last, I have avoided calculus, linear algebra, and, for that matter, quadratic terms (though some inequalities do sneak in at times). That said, the book includes a large number of backof-the-envelope calculations in settings as concrete as I could make them illustrating various networking concepts. Overall, I tried to nd a happy medium between practical matters and underlying principles. My goal has been to create a book that is useful to a broad audience, including those interested in network management, in high-performance networking, in software development, or just in how the Internet is put together. One of the best ways to gain insight into why a certain design choice was made is to look at a few alternative implementations. To that end, this book includes coverage of some topics one may never encounter in practice, but which may be useful as points of comparison. These topics arguably include ATM ( Asynchronous Transfer Mode: ATM ), SCTP ( SCTP ) and even Mbps Ethernet ( -Mbps Classic Ethernet ). The book can also be used as a networks supplement or companion to other resources for
