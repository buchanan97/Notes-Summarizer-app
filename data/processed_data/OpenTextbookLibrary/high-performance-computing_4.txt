The team at Connexions has been wonderful to work with. W e share a passion for High Performance Computing and new forms of publishing so that the knowledge reaches as many people as possible. I want to thank Jan Odegard and Kathi Fletcher for encouraging, supporting and helping me through the re-publishing process. Daniel W illiamson did an amazing job of converting the materials from the O'Reilly formats to the Connexions formats. I truly look forward to seeing how far this book will go now that we can have an unlimited number of co-authors to invest and then use the book. I look forward to work with you all. Charles Severance - November , 2009 Introduction to High Performance Computing This is an introduction to the book High Performance Computing. Why W orry About Performance? Over the last decade, the definition of what is called high performance computing has changed dramatically . In 1988, an article appeared in the Wall Street Journal titled Attack of the Killer Micros that described how computing systems made up of many small inexpensive processors would soon make lar ge supercomputers obsolete. At that time, a personal computer costing 3000 could perform million floating-point operations per second, a workstation costing , could perform million floating-point operations, and a supercomputer costing million could perform million floating-point operations per second. Therefore, why couldn t we simply connect personal computers together to achieve the same performance of a supercomputer for million? This vision has come true in some ways, but
