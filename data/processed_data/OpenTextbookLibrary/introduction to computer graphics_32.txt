Coordinates, and Colors To create a two-dimensional image, each point in the image is assigned a color. A point in D can be identi ed by a pair of numerical coordinate s. Colors can also be speci ed numerically. However, the assignment of numbers to points o r colors is somewhat arbitrary. So we need to spend some time studying coordinate systems , which associate numbers to points, and color models , which associate numbers to colors. Pixel Coordinates A digital image is made up of rows and columns of pixels. A pixe l in such an image can be speci ed by saying which column and which row contains it. In terms of coordinates, a pixel can be identi ed by a pair of integers giving the column numbe r and the row number. For example, the pixel with coordinates ( , ) would lie in colum n number and row number . Conventionally, columns are numbered from left to right, st arting with zero. Most graphics systems, including the ones we will study in this chapter, nu mber rows from top to bottom, starting from zero. Some, including Open GL, number the rows from bottom to top instead.

On the left, rows are numbered from top to bottom, on the right, they are numberd bottom to top. 5678 ( , ) ( , ) Note in particular that the pixel that is identi ed by a pair o f coordinates ( x,y) depends on the choice of coordinate system. You always need to know what coo rdinate system is in use before you know
