As an example, I present a case study motivated by a question I heard when my wife and I were expecting our rst child: do rst babies tend to arrive late? If you Google this question, you will nd plenty of discussion. Some people claim it's true, others say it's a myth, and some people say it's the other way around: rst babies come early.
