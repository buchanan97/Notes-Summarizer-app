CPU works to convert 1s and 0s into the amazing devices that are so central to our world. DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS Reading this text This textbook is intended for multiple audiences . Chapter of this text is an overview of Boolean algebra and included largely for when the text is use in classes covering digital circuit design. Chapter is not necessary to the understanding of the rest of the book, and can be safely skipped by som eone using this text as a lab manual . I would recommend that a hobbyist using this book for bread board project skip Chapter altogether. Chapter is an implementation of a CPU in Logisim, and shows how a CPU can be desi gned using only wires, gates, and the ICs that are covered in this text. The implementation is a real CPU which can be programmed, producing input and output. However even this simple CPU is too complex to implement in a Breadboard. Chapters to are the chapters which implement the projects. These chapters are the important chapters for someone interested in implementing the ICs used in a CPU. Materials Needed This section will outline the materials you will need for the rest of the book. There ar e two types of materials you will need. The first will be a software program called Logisim, and the second will be physical parts needed to implement the circuits on a breadboard. Logisim Logisim is a tool which is used to describe the ci rcuits found in this book. Logisim is free and easy to use, and can be found at http: ozark.hendrix.edu burch logisim .
