What makes thi s textboo k unique i s that it puts the a bility to unde rstand the se circuits in to the h ands of anyone, from ho bbyists to stude nts study ing Comput er Science. Thi s text is de signed to teach d igital circuits usin g simp le pr ojects the r eader can imp lement. But unl ike mos t lab m anuals used in cl asses in Di gital C ircuits or C omput er Or ganization cl asses, thi s textboo k is de signed to remove the b arrier of a l aboratory infrastructur e ne eded in a fa ce-to-face environme nt at a c ollege or univ ersity. Thi s textboo k is de signed to be used by the r eader to create the c ircuits in their o wn home s. The t extboo k is free. The c ost of the k its ne eded to do the l abs is reasonable. And the pr ojects a re well doc ume nted and ca n be imp lemented by even no vices to electronic pr ojects. This text allows professors to add laboratory projects in d igital circuits t o stude nts in onl ine cl asses in Comput er Or ganization. Thi s enhances the se classes with in teresting and f un exe rcises that reinfor ce the classroom t opics. This text can also be us ed by a ho bbyist who w ants to learn mor e about d igital circuits a nd ho w comput ers work.
