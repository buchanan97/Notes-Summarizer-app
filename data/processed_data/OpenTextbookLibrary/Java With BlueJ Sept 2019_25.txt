that can be used for exactly the above , but it is much more verbose. Example Suppose you need to display the larger of two values x and y. To do this we can use the above expression inside a display statement., as in: System.out.println("l argest is " ((x y) ? x : y ) ); Exercises . Write a program that obtains a String (a password) from the user and displays the message too short if the length of the password is less than . Note that if passwd is of type String then passwd .length () is the number of characters (the length) of the value stored in passwd . Operator Priorities We have seen arithmetic, relational, and boolean operators so f ar. The table below shows these operators and several others: method invocation, postincrement, post -decrement , and assignment. Priorities of Operators priority Java operator meaning name of a method( ) method invocation post -increment post-decrement - unary minus ! boolean not new object creation division multiplication modulo addition - minus string catenation less than less than or equal to greater than greater than or equal to equals ! not equals boolean and boolean or ? : conditional operator assignment assignment with operation - assignment with operation assignment with operation assignment with operation assignment with operati on Previously we stated some operators had the same priority as others, and that some had a lower higher priority that some others. In the table above you see the actual operator priorities. For example, both unary minus and boolean not have the same prio rity ( ) which is much higher than most others. Assignment has the lowest priority (
