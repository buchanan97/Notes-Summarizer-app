all values should have the same frequency. In fact, is more common than the other values, and and are less common, probably because respondents round o birth weights that are close to an integer value. Figure shows the histogram of agepreg , the mother's age at the end of pregnancy. The mode is years. The distribution is very roughly bellshaped, but in this case the tail extends farther to the right than left; most mothers are in their 20s, fewer in their 30s. Figure shows the histogram of prglngth , the length of the pregnancy in weeks. By far the most common value is weeks. The left tail is longer than the right; early babies are common, but pregnancies seldom go past weeks, and doctors often intervene if they do. Outliers Looking at histograms, it is easy to identify the most common values and the shape of the distribution, but rare values are not always visible. Before going on, it is a good idea to check for outliers , which are extreme values that might be errors in measurement and recording, or might be accurate reports of rare events. Hist provides methods Largest and Smallest , which take an integer nand return the nlargest or smallest values from the histogram: for weeks, freq in hist.Smallest( ): print(weeks, freq) In the list of pregnancy lengths for live births, the lowest values are , , , , , , , , , . Values below weeks are certainly errors; the most likely explanation is that the outcome was not coded correctly. Values higher than weeks are probably legitimate. Between . First babies and weeks, it is hard to be sure; some values
