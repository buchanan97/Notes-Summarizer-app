possibly with some l arge number of inputs whose computations cannot be duplicated with and,or, andnot gates? Any logical operator or logic gate computes a value fo r each possible combination of logical values of its inputs. We could always make a truth table showing the output for each possible combination of inputs. As it turns out, givenanysuch truth table, it is possible to nd a proposition, contai ning only the , , and operators, whose value for each combination of inputs is giv en precisely by that table.

A conjunction of s imple terms would then consist of one or more simple terms put together with operators. (A CHAPTER . LOGIC AND PROOF Figure : This circuit contains a feedback loop, so it is no t a combinatorial logic circuit. The feedback loop includes the andgate and theorgate on the right. This circuit does not compute the value of a compound proposition. This circuit does, however, play an i mportant role in computer memories, since it can be used to store a logi cal value.

The numbering of the labels shows one of the orders in which they can be associated with the wires.
