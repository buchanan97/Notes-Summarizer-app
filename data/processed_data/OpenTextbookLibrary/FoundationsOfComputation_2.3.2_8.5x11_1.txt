If youknowthatallhumansaremortal, andyouknowthatyouareh uman, thenin a sense you know that you are mortal, whether or not you have ev er considered or wanted to consider that fact. This is an example of logical deduction : From the premises that All humans are mortal and I am human, the conclusion that I am mortal can be deduced by logic. Logical deduction is a kind of computation. By applying rule s of logic to a given set of premises, conclusions that follow from those p remises can be generated automatically, by a computational process which could be carried out by a computer. Once you know the premises, or are willing to ac cept them for the sake of argument, you are forced by logic to accept the con clusions. Still, to say that you know those conclusions would be misleading . The problem is that there are too many of them (in nitely many), and, in gene ral, most of them are not particularly interesting. Until you have actually m ade the deduction, you don t reallyknow the conclusion, and knowing which of the possible chain s of deduction to follow is not easy. The artof logic is
