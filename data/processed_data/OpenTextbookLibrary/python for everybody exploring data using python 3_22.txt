the program on a screen or store them in a le or perhaps write them to a device like a speaker to play music or speak text. sequential execution Perform statements one after another in the order they are encountered in the script. conditional execution Check for certain conditions and then execute or skip a sequence of statements. repeated execution Perform some set of statements repeatedly, usually with some variation. reuse Write a set of instructions once and give them a name and then reuse those instructions as needed throughout your program. It sounds almost too simple to be true, and of course it is never so simple. It is like saying that walking is simply putting one foot in front of the other . The art of writing a program is composing and weaving these basic elements together many times over to produce something that is useful to its users. The word counting program above directly uses all of these patterns except for one. What could possibly go wrong? As we saw in our earliest conversations with Python, we must communicate very precisely when we write Python code. The smallest deviation or mistake will ca use Python to give up looking at your program. Beginning programmers often take the fact that Python leaves no room for error s as evidence that Python is mean, hateful, and cruel. While Python seems to like everyone else, Python knows them personally and holds a grudge against them. Because of this grudge, Python takes our perfectly written programs and rejects them as un t just to torment us. primt quotesingle.ts1 Hello world! quotesingle.ts1 File " stdin " , line primt quotesingle.ts1 Hello world!
