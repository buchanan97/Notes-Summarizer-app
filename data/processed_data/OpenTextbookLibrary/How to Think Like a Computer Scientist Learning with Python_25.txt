the subject and fell is the predicate. Once you have parsed a sentence, you can gure out what it means, or the semantics of the sentence. Assuming that you know what a shoe is and what it means to fall, you will understand the general implication of this sentence. Although formal and natural languages have many features in common tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics there are many di erences: ambiguity: Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context. redundancy: In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise. literalness: Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If I say, The other shoe fell, there is probably no shoe and nothing falling. Formal languages mean exactly what they say. People who grow up speaking a natural language everyone often have a hard time adjusting to formal languages. In some ways, the di erence between forma l and natural language is like the di erence between poetry and prose, but more so: Poetry: Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an e ect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate. Prose: The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous. Programs: The meaning of a computer
