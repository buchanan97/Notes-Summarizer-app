the end user of your programs. As you gain skill as a programmer and programming feels more creative to you, your thoughts may turn toward developing programs for others. . COMPUTER HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE Input and Output Devices Software Main Memory Central Processing Unit What Next? Network Secondary Memory Figure : Hardware Architecture Computer hardware architecture Before we start learning the language we speak to give instructions to computer s to develop software, we need to learn a small amount about how computers are built. If you were to take apart your computer or cell phone and look deep inside, you would nd the following parts: The high-level de nitions of these parts are as follows: The Central Processing Unit (or CPU) is the part of the computer that is built to be obsessed with what is next? If your computer is rated at Gigahertz, it means that the CPU will ask What next? three billion times per second. You are going to have to learn how to talk fast to keep up with the CPU. The Main Memory is used to store information that the CPU needs in a hurry. The main memory is nearly as fast as the CPU. But the information stored in the main memory vanishes when the computer is turned o . The Secondary Memory is also used to store information, but it is much slower than the main memory. The advantage of the secondary memory is that it can store information even when there is no power to the computer. Examples of secondary memory are disk drives or ash memory (typically found in USB sticks and portable music players). The Input and Output Devices are
