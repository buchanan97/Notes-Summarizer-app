connected to external memory ( RAM chips). Microcontrollers generally contain sufficient on-board memory to alleviate this requirement but it is worthwhile to note that we are not talking about large (megabyte) quantities. A microcontroller may only contain a few hundred bytes of memory but in simple applications that may be sufficient. Remember, a byte of memory consists of bits, each bit being thought of as a , high low, yes no, or true false pair. In order for a processor to operate on data held in memory, the data must first be copied into a processor s register (it may have dozens of registers). Only in a register can mathematical or logical operations be carried out. For example, if you desire to add one to a variable, the value of the variable must first be copied into a register. The addition is performed on the register contents yielding the answer. This answer is then copied back to the original memory location of the variable. It seems a little roundabout at first, but don t worry, the C language compiler will take care of most of those details for you. Memory Maps Every byte of memory in a computer system has an address associated with it. This is a requirement. Without an address, the processor has no way of identifying a specific location in memory. Generally, memory addressing starts at and works its way up, although some addresses may be special or reserved in some systems. That is, a specific address might not refer to normal memory, but instead might refer to a certain input output port for external communication. Very often it is useful to draw a memory map. This
