So while the circuits in the text will generally use a HCT08 N chip, the text will refer to the chip as a 7408 chip. Tools A few tools are useful to implement the labs in this text. The wire strippers are the only required tool, but needle nose pliers are very handy when doing wiring, and a flat blade screw driver makes it much easier to pry chips from the board safely. These tools are often in toolboxes that the reader might alre ady have. If the reader does not have one or more of these tools, they should be obtained. wire stripper needle nose pliers small bladed screw driver Miscellaneous A number of miscellaneous parts are needed to implement the circuits in this text. The number of type of these parts is limited specifically to keep the cost of the kits to a minimum. For example, the labs in the text use colors of wire for clarity: red, black, yellow, and green. The kits below only include black wire. The reader can obtain multiple colors of wire if they desire, but the circuits can be impleme nted using a single color wire. Be careful of substitutions. For example, a point solderless breadboard is cheaper than the point solderless breadboard
