Dct(dct file) df dct.Read Fixed Width(dat file, compression gzip ) Clean Fem Preg(df) return df Read Stata Dct takes the name of the dictionary le and returns dct, a Fixed Width Variables object that contains the information from the dictionary le. dctprovides Read Fixed Width , which reads the data le. Data Frames The result of Read Fixed Width is a Data Frame, which is the fundamental data structure provided by pandas, which is a Python data and statistics package we'll use throughout this book. A Data Frame contains a row for each record, in this case one row per pregnancy, and a column for each variable. Chapter . Exploratory data analysis In addition to the data, a Data Frame also contains the variable names and their types, and it provides methods for accessing and modifying the data. If you print dfyou get a truncated view of the rows and columns, and the shape of the Data Frame, which is 13593 rows records and columns variables. import nsfg df nsfg.Read Fem Preg() df 13593 rows x columns The Data Frame is too big to display, so the output is truncated. The last line reports the number of rows and columns. The attribute columns returns a sequence of column names as Unicode strings: df.columns Index( u caseid , u pregordr , u howpreg n , u howpreg p , ) The result is an Index, which is another pandas data structure. We'll learn more about Index later, but for now we'll treat it like a list: df.columns pregordr To access a column from a Data Frame, you can use the column name as a key: pregordr df pregordr type(pregordr) class pandas.core.series.Series
