some skill at writing programs that interact over the Internet. In neither case will you become a master programmer. However, in both cases, you will be laying a foundation of skills that are relevant to a range of development projects and environments. Another example of a skill you can acquire is the ability to look at the security rami cations of design decisions. I have a security section in each chapter, rather than a security chapter only at the end of the book, because I want you to develop the habit of asking, What are the security issues here?" That question is relevant even outside the realm of operating systems and middleware. As I hope you can see, studying operating systems and middleware can provide a wide range of bene ts, particularly if you engage yourself in it as an active participant, rather than as a spectator. With that for motivation, I will now take you on another tour of the services operating systems and middleware provide. This tour is more detailed than Sections and , but not as detailed as Chapters through . Multiple Computations on One Computer The single most fundamental service an operating system provides is to allow multiple computations to be going on at the same time, rather than forcing each to wait until the previous one has run to completion. This allows desktop computers to juggle multiple tasks for the busy humans seated in front of their screens, and it allows server computers to be responsive to requests originating from many di erent client computers on the Internet. Beyond these responsiveness concerns, concurrent computations can also CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION make more e cient use of
