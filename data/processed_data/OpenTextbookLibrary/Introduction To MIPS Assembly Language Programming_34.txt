Logical and Bitwise Opera tors Chapter . Boolean Operators Boolean operators are operators which are designed to operate on a Boolean or binary data. They take in one or more input values of and combine those bits to create an output value Note that the values are used here rather than F T. These operators will be described through the rest of the book using the binary values , so there is no reason to be inconsistent here. INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING which is either . This text will only deal with the most common Boolean operators, the unary operator NOT (or inverse), and the binary operators5 AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR. These operators are usually characterized by their truth tables, and two truth tables are given below for these operators. A NOT Table - : Truth table for NOT operator The term unary operator means having one input. The term binary operator means having two inputs. Be careful reading this sentence, as binary is used in two different contexts. The binary operator AND operates on binary data. INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING Input Output A B AND OR NAND NOR XOR Table - : Truth table for AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR Chapter . Logical and Bitwise Boolean Operators There are two kinds of Boolean operators implemented in many programming languages. They are logical operators and bitwise operators. Logica l operators perform Boolean operations to obtain a single value at the end. For example, in Java a programmer might write: if ((x ! ) (y x )) The purpose of this statement is to decide whether or not to enter the statement
