the letter directly to the target person only if they knew him personally; otherwise they were instructed to send it, and the same instructions, to a relative or friend they thought would be more likely to know the target person. Many of the letters were never delivered, but for the ones that were the average path length the number of times the letters were forwarded was about six. This result was taken to con rm previous observations (and speculations) that the typical distance between any two people in a social network is about six degrees of separation". This conclusion is surprising because most people expect social networks to be localized people tend to live near their friends and in a graph with local connections, path lengths tend to increase in proportion to geographical distance. For example, most of my friends live nearby, so I would guess that the average distance between nodes in a social network is about miles. Wichita is about 1600 miles from Boston, so if Milgram's letters traversed typical links in the social network, they should have taken hops, not . Watts and Strogatz In 1998 Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz published a paper in Nature , Collective dynamics of small-world' networks", that proposed an explanation for the small world phenomenon.

In a random graph, nodes are connected at random. In a regular graph, every node has the same number of neighbors. They consider two properties of these graphs, clustering and path length: Watts and Strogatz Clustering is a measure
