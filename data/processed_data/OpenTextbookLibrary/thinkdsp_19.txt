this wave should be at 3300, 5500, 7700, and 9900 Hz. In the gure, there are peaks at 1100 and 3300 Hz, as expected, but the third peak is at 4500, not 5500 Hz. The fourth peak is at 2300, not 7700 Hz. And if you look closely, the peak that should be at 9900 is actually at Hz. What's going on? The problem is that when you evaluate the signal at discrete points in time, you lose information about what happened between samples. For low frequency components, that's not a problem, because you have lots of samples per period. But if you sample a signal at 5000 Hz with , frames per second, you only have two samples per period. That turns out to be enough, just barely, but if the frequency is higher, it's not. Chapter .

The view on the right is scaled to show the harmonics. To see why, let's generate cosine signals at 4500 and 5500 Hz, and sample them at , frames per second: framerate 10000 signal thinkdsp.Cos Signal(4500) duration signal.period segment signal.make wave(duration, framerate framerate) segment.plot() signal thinkdsp.Cos Signal(5500) segment signal.make wave(duration, framerate framerate) segment.plot() Figure shows the result. I plotted the Signals with thin gray lines and the samples using vertical lines, to make it easier to compare the two Waves. The problem should be clear: even though the Signals are di erent, the Waves are identical! When we sample a 5500 Hz signal at , frames per second, the
