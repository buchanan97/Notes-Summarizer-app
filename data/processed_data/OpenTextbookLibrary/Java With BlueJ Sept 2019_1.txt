Code listings: Student, Subject Preface This book is Part I of a two -part set that introduces the Java programming language. The text assumes the student will be using the Blue J development environment and provides some introductory Blue J material. Our experience has been that Blue J is easy to l earn and provides a good programming environment for the beginner programmer. The material in chapters through are required topics. Chapter : This is a high -level introduction to Java. We discuss the Hello World program , and how to run Hello World in Bl ue J. Chapter : Basic concepts having to do with constants, variables, data types, expressions and input output are covered. Chapter : This chapter covers the major control structures a programmer uses. Chapter : Methods are indispensable for organizing your code into modular components. Some programs present a solution to a complex problem. To help manage that complexity we can use methods where each method handles one small part of the overall solution.. Chapter : Java provides a great deal of functio nality in its class libraries. We introduce several classes such as Random Random gives the programmer the ability to simulate throwing dice or tossing coins. As well, useful functionality in utility classes such as Math, Integer, and Character are cove red. Chapter : Many applications require a program to work with collections of data. For example, the set of courses at a university is a collection. Java programs must be able to manage such a set and the Array List data structure is well -suited to the ta sk. Chapter : The program code in a Java system is managed in structures
