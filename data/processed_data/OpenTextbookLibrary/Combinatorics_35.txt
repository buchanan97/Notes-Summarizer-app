or omelette ornothing, so the sum rule applied here. (Note that we didn t actually consider each of these four things separately, since they naturally fell into two categories. However, we would have reached the same answer if we had considered each of them separately.) Similarly, whether or not she had extra options available for her side dish depended on whether she chose toast or not, so again the sum rule applied. In Example , the plates can be regular (in either of two ways) orveteran ormotorcycle plates, so the sum rule was used. In each of these categories, we had to consider the options for the first character andthe second character (and so on), so the product rule applied. Finally, in Example , the shirt Ming chooses can be short-sleeved orlong-sleeved, so the sum rule applies to that distinction. Since she wants to choose a shirt andgift wrap, the product rule applies to that combination. EXERCISES . For each of the following problems, do you need to use the sum rule, the product rule, or both? )Count all of the numbers that have exactly two digits, and the numbers that have exactly four digits. )How many possible outcomes are there from rolling a red die and a yellow die? )How many possible outcomes are there from rolling three dice, if you only count the outcomes that involve at most one of the dice coming up as a one? SUMMARY: Product rule Sum rule Combining the product and sum rules Chapter Permutations, Combinations, and the Binomial Theorem The examples we looked at in Chapter involved drawing things from an effectively infinite population they couldn t run out.
