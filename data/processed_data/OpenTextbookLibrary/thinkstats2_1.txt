for nding possible relationships and e ects. Then if an apparent e ect holds up to scrutiny, visualization is an e ective way to communicate results. vi Chapter . Preface This book takes a computational approach, which has several advantages over mathematical approaches: I present most ideas using Python code, rather than mathematical notation. In general, Python code is more readable; also, because it is executable, readers can download it, run it, and modify it. Each chapter includes exercises readers can do to develop and solidify their learning. When you write programs, you express your understanding in code; while you are debugging the program, you are also correcting your understanding. Some exercises involve experiments to test statistical behavior. For example, you can explore the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) by generating random samples and computing their sums. The resulting visualizations demonstrate why the CLT works and when it doesn't. Some ideas that are hard to grasp mathematically are easy to understand by simulation. For example, we approximate p-values by running random simulations, which reinforces the meaning of the p-value. Because the book is based on a general-purpose programming language (Python), readers can import data from almost any source. They are not limited to datasets that have been cleaned and formatted for a particular statistics tool. The book lends itself to a project-based approach. In my class, students work on a semester-long project that requires them to pose a statistical question, nd a dataset that can address it, and apply each of the techniques they learn to their own data. To demonstrate my approach to statistical analysis, the book presents a case study that runs through all of the chapters. It uses
