Topology An Introduction to Computer Networks, Release Routing Loops A potential drawback to datagram forwarding is the possibility of a routing loop : a set of entries in the forwarding tables that cause some packets to circulate endlessly. For example, in the previous picture we would have a routing loop if, for (nonexistent) destination C, S1 forwarded to S2, S2 forwarded to S4, S4 forwarded to S3, and S3 forwarded to S1. A packet sent to C would not only not be delivered, but in circling endlessly it might easily consume a large majority of the bandwidth. Routing loops typically arise because the creation of the forwarding tables is often distributed , and there is no global authority to detect inconsistencies. Even when there is such an authority, temporary routing loops can be created due to noti cation delays. Routing loops can also occur in networks where the underlying link topology is loop-free; for example, in the previous diagram we could, again for destination C, have S1 forward to S2 and S2 forward back to S1. We will refer to such a case as a linear routing loop. All datagram-forwarding protocols need some way of detecting and avoiding routing loops. Ethernet, for example, avoids nonlinear routing loops by disallowing loops in the underlying network topology, and avoids linear routing loops by not having switches forward a packet back out the interface by which it arrived. IP provides for a one-byte Time to Live (TTL) eld in the IP header; it is set by the sender and decremented by at each router; a packet is discarded if its TTL reaches . This limits the number of times a wayward
