rand the frequency resolution is r n which isr n. Ideally we would like time resolution to be small, so we can see rapid changes in frequency. And we would like frequency resolution to be small so we can see small changes in frequency. But you can't have both. Notice that time resolution, n r, is the inverse of frequency resolution, r n. So if one gets smaller, the other gets bigger. For example, if you double the segment length, you cut frequency resolution in half (which is good), but you double time resolution (which is bad). Even increasing the framerate doesn't help. You get more samples, but the range of frequencies increases at the same time. This tradeo is called the Gabor limit and it is a fundamental limitation of this kind of time-frequency analysis. Leakage In order to explain how make spectrogram works, I have to explain windowing; and in order to explain windowing, I have to show you the problem it is meant to address, which is leakage. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which we use to compute Spectrums, treats waves as if they are periodic; that is, it assumes that the nite segment it operates on is a complete period from an in nite signal that repeats over all time. In practice, this assumption is often false, which creates problems. One common problem is discontinuity at the beginning and end of the segment. Because DFT assumes that the signal is periodic, it implicitly connects the end of the segment back to the beginning to make a loop. If the end does not connect smoothly to the beginning, the discontinuity creates additional frequency components in the segment
