too seriously. And I don't mean to deprecate classical science. A more complicated model is not necessarily better; in fact, it is usually worse. And I don't mean to say that these changes are abrupt or complete. Rather, there is a gradual migration in the frontier of what is considered acceptable, respectable work. Some tools that used to be regarded with suspicion are now common, and some models that were widely accepted are now regarded with scrutiny. For example, when Appel and Haken proved the four-color theorem in 1976, they used a computer to enumerate , special cases that were, in some sense, lemmas of their proof. At the time, many mathematicians did not consider Chapter Complexity Science the theorem truly proved. Now computer-assisted proofs are common and generally (but not universally) accepted. Conversely, a substantial body of economic analysis is based on a model of human behavior called Economic man", or, with tongue in cheek, Homo economicus . Research based on this model was highly regarded for several decades, especially if it involved mathematical virtuosity. More recently, this model is treated with skepticism, and models that include imperfect information and bounded rationality are hot topics. Di erent models for di erent purposes Complex models are often appropriate for di erent purposes and interpretations: Predictive!explanatory Schelling's model of segregation might shed light on a complex social phenomenon, but it is not useful for prediction. On the other hand, a simple model of celestial mechanics can predict solar eclipses, down to the second, years in the future. Realism!instrumentalism Classical models lend themselves to a realist interpretation; for example, most people accept that electrons are real things that exist. Instrumentalism is the
