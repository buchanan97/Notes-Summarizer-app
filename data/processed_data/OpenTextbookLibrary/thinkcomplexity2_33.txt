can test it like this: nodes range( ) for edge in adjacent edges(nodes, ): print(edge) ( , ) ( , ) ( , ) Now we can use adjacent edges to make a ring lattice: def make ring lattice(n, k): G nx.Graph() nodes range(n) G.add nodes from(nodes) G.add edges from(adjacent edges(nodes, k )) return G Notice that make ring lattice uses oor division to compute halfk , so it is only correct if kis even. If kis odd, oor division rounds down, so the result is a ring lattice with degree k- . As one of the exercises at the end of the chapter, you will generate regular graphs with odd values of k. We can test make ring lattice like this: lattice make ring lattice( , ) Figure shows the result. Chapter Small World Graphs Figure : WS graphs with n ,k , andp (left),p : (middle), andp (right). WS graphs To make a Watts-Strogatz (WS) graph, we start with a ring lattice and rewire" some of the edges. In their paper, Watts and Strogatz consider the edges in a particular order and rewire each one with probability p. If an edge is rewired, they leave the rst node unchanged and choose the second node at random. They don't allow self loops or multiple edges; that is, you can't have a edge from a node to itself, and you can't have more than one edge between the same two nodes. Here is my implementation of this process. def rewire(G, p): nodes set(G) for u, v in G.edges(): if flip(p): choices nodes - u - set(G u ) new v np.random.choice(list(choices)) G.remove edge(u, v) G.add edge(u, new v) The parameter
