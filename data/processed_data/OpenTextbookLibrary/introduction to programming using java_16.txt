numbers. The CPU fetches machine language instructions from memory one afte r another and executes them. Each instruction makes the CPU perform some very small task, such as adding two numbers or movingdatatoorfrommemory. The CPUdoesallthismechanica lly, withoutthinkingaboutor understanding what it does and therefore the program it exe cutes must be perfect, complete in all details, and unambiguous because the CPU can do nothin g but execute it exactly as written. Here is a schematic view of this rst-stage underst anding of the computer: Data to Memory Data from Memory Address for reading writing data CPUMemory 10001010 (Location ) 00001100 (Location ) 10111000 (Location ) 01000001 (Location ) 00001011 (Location ) 11011101 (Location ) 10110000 (Location ) 01010010 (Location ) 11111010 (Location ) 01001100 (Location ) 00100011 (Location ) 00011010 (Location ) Registers PCALU Asynchronous Events: Polling Loops and Interrupts The CPU spends almost all of its time fetching instructions from memory and executing them. However, the CPU and main memory are only two out of many components in a real computer system. A complete system contains other devices s uch as: Ahard disk orsolid state drive for storing programs and data les. (Note that main memory holds only a comparatively small amount of informati on, and holds it only as long as the power is turned on. A hard disk or solid state drive is used for permanent storage of larger amounts of information, but programs have to be loaded from there into main memory before they can actually be executed. A hard disk stores data on a spinning magnetic disk, while a solid state drive is a purely electron ic device with no moving parts.) CHAPTER . THE MENTAL
