which is rule from the Boolean relationship table, X X X , and means that any term in the summation can be used more than once in minimizing the circuit. To show that the final equation corresponds to the initial truth tabl e, algebra will be used to reduce the expression from DNF to the final form. f(A,B,C) ( , , , , ) A'B'C' AB'C' AB'C ABC' ABC A'B'C' AB'C' AB'C' AB'C ABC' ABC (rule ) (A A') B'C' (AB' AB)(C C') (rule ) ( ) (B'C') (AB' AB) ( ) (rule ) B'C' AB' AB (rule ) (B'C') A(B' B) (rule ) (B'C') A( ) (rule ) (B'C') A (rule ) -Variable Karnaugh Maps While K -maps larger than variables exist, they require more than dimensions and are thus hard to solve by hand, though there are algorithmic ways to do this and there are many programs online that can solve them. This text is only interested in presenting the concept of K -maps and how they are solved, so it will end with presenting - Varable K -maps. -Variable K -maps correspond to Boolean functions of the form f(A, B, C, D). The K -maps again allow a truth table to be mapped so that rows and columns that diffe r by or values are placed next to each other. To do this, the Gray Codes that were introduced earlier are used. Note how the values for variables A,B and C,D are numbered as Gray Codes in the - variable K - map table. DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS AB CD A'B'C'D A'B'C D A'B CD A'B CD A BC D A BC D A BCD A'BC'D ABC
