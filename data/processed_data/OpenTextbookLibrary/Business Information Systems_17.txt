Analysis . Requirements (vision of future state) . Design . Development . Implementation In this course we will cover all five stages. However we will focus most heavily on the first three stages for two reasons. Fi rst, because that is where IS professionals tend to spend most of their time and second Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org books Saylor.org because it is much easier to make changes to a system when in the planning stages, than after code has already been generated. It is good to frequently interact with th e end user and show them screen mockups and a systems architecture diagram of what the final system will look like. The systems architecture is a hierarchy diagram of the flow of the website or app what the relationship between the pages of the system will be. It is sometimes called a site map. Ideally the systems architecture is done on paper with sticky notes that can be moved around at will by multiple users. A final systems architecture can be represented as a hierarchy chart in Power Point. Once the sys tems architecture is complete, wireframes or mockups of the individual pages may be constructed. Mockups are non -functioning pages generated in a drawing program such as Photo Shop, Omnigraffle (Mac), or even Power Point. Power Point turns out to be a fairly respectable mockup tool especially when working off of some predefined templates. The SDLC in action. By analogy think of home improvement shows on TV. such as Curb Appeal. They typically follow a similar life cycle when improving a home. The current sta te of the home is analyzed in consultation with the resident. During this stage
