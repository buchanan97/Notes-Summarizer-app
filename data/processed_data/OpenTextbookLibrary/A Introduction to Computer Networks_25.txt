destination match is found. Here is a forwarding table for S1, above, with a default entry replacing the last three entries: S1 destination next hop A C default Default entries make sense only when we can tell by looking at an address that it does not represent a nearby node. This is common in IP networks because an IP address encodes the destination network, and routers generally know all the local networks. It is however rare in Ethernets, because there is generally no correlation between Ethernet addresses and locality. If S1 above were an Ethernet switch, and it had some means of knowing that interfaces and connected directly to individual hosts, not switches and S1 knew the addresses of these hosts then making interface a default route would make sense. In practice, however, Ethernet switches do not know what kind of device connects to a given interface. Topology In the network diagrammed in the previous section, there are no loops; graph theorists might describe this by saying the network graph is acyclic , or is a tree. In a loop-free network there is a unique path between any pair of nodes. The forwarding-table algorithm has only to make sure that every destination appears in the forwarding tables; the issue of choosing between alternative paths does not arise. However, if there are no loops then there is no redundancy : any broken link will result in partitioning the network into two pieces that cannot communicate. All else being equal (which it is not, but never mind for now), redundancy is a good thing. However, once we start including redundancy, we have to make decisions among the multiple paths to a destination.
