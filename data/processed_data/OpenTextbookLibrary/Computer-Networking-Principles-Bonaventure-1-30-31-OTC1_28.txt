will then convert the sequence of bits in an electromagnetic or optical signal that will be sent over the physical medium. The physical layer on the right hand side of the gure will decode the received signal, recover the bits and issue the corresponding Data.indication primitives to its Datalink layer entity. If there are no transmission errors, this entity will receive the frame sent earlier. Datalink Physical Frames Datalink Physical Figure : The Datalink layer The Datalink layer allows directly connected hosts to exchange information, but it is often necessary to exchange information between hosts that are not attached to the same physical medium. This is the task of the network layer. The network layer is built above the datalink layer. Network layer entities exchange packets. A packet is a nite sequence of bytes that is transported by the datalink layer inside one or more frames. A packet usually Chapter .

However, many applications need to exchange information reliably and so using the network layer service directly would be very dif cult for them. Ensuring the reliable delivery of the data produced by applications is the task of the transport layer. Transport layer entities exchange segments. A segment is a nite sequence
