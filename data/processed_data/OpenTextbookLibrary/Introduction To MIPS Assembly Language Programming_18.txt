conditions are hard to define. There is a way to implement the conversion which results in a nicer algorithm. The second way to convert a decimal number to binary is to do successive divisions by the number . This is because if a number is divided and the remainder taken, the remainder is the value of the bit. Likewise if the result of step is divided again by (so essentially dividing by or ), the reminder is the value of the bit. This proces s is continued until the result of the division is . The example below shows how this works. Start with the number . divided by is with a remainder of . So in step the result would have the first bit for the power of set to one, as below: r - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING The number is now divided by to give , and the remainder, zero, placed in the second bit. r The process continues to divide by , filling the remainder in each appropriate bit, until at last the result is , as below. Chapter . Converting between binary and hexadecimal One of the biggest problems with binary is that the numbers rapidly become very hard to read. This is also true in decimal, where there is often a "," inserted between groupings of . So for example 1632134 is often written as , , , which is easier to read. In binary, something similar is done. Most students are familiar with the term byte, which is bits. But
