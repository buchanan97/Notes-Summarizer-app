JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS11 Figure :A Jupyter Notebook with one Markdown cell and one Code cell. In the top image, the two cells have been edited but not yet run hence the Markdown formatting is unrendered and the code has not been executed. The bottom pane shows both cells after the use has chosen Run All from the Cell menu. Run All, the picture changes: you see the formatted message in the top cell, and theoutputof the Python code snippet after it runs. (The latter is easy to miss; stare at that bottom picture and CHAPTER . A TRIP TO JUPYTER find the Our country is years old! message. That s the output. ) We haven t yet covered what that Python code means (that s the main subject of this book) but you can probably guess some of what it s doing. Code and output Incredibly, that s about it. Everything else in this book is going to concern what to type in those Code cells and how to interpret its output. From now on, whenever I give example Python code in this book, I ll write it in a box like this: founding 1776 usa age 2025 - founding print("Our country is years old!".format(usa age)) That box means this stuff goes in a Code cell of a Notebook. When I write the corresponding output (i.e., what gets printed on the page immediately below the code cell when Run All is chosen from the Cell menu), I ll write it like this: Our country is
