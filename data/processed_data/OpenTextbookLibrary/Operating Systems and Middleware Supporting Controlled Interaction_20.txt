between the kernel and the user interface applies to Linux. The Linux kernel provides the basic operating system services through an API, whereas shells are the programs (such as bash and tcsh) that interpret typed commands, and desktop environments are the programs, such as KDE (K Desktop Environment) and GNOME, that handle graphical interaction. In this book, I will explain the workings of operating system kernels, the true operating systems themselves, as opposed to the user-interface programs. One reason is because user-interface programs are not constructed in any fundamentally di erent way than normal application programs. The CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION other reason is because an operating system need not have this sort of user interface at all. Consider again the case of an embedded system that controls automotive fuel injection. If the system is su ciently sophisticated, it may include an operating system. The main control program may run other, more specialized programs. However, there is no ability for the user to start an arbitrary program running through a shell or desktop environment. In this book, I will draw my examples from general-purpose systems with which you might be familiar, but will emphasize the principles that could apply in other contexts as well. What Is Middleware? Now that you know what an operating system is, I can turn to the other category of software covered by this book: middleware . Middleware is software occupying a middle position between application programs and operating systems, as I will explain in this section. Operating systems and middleware have much in common. Both are software used to support other software, such as the application programs you run. Both provide a similar range of services
