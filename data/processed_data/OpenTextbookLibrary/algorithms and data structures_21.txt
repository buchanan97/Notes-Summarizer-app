directed straight-line segments the starting point of the next segment coincides with the endpoint of the previous one. 'Polyline' is the most useful tool for interactive input of most drawings made up of straight lines. The user clicks a starting point, and each subsequent click extends the polyline by another line segment. A double click terminates the polyline. We developed 'Poly Line' starting from the frame program above, in particular the procedure 'Drag Line', modifying and adding a few procedures. Once 'Polyline' worked, we simplified the frame program a bit. For example, the original frame program uses reals to represent coordinates of points, because most geometric computation is done that way. A polyline on a graphics screen only needs integers, so we changed the type 'point' to integer coordinates. At the moment, the code for polyline input is partly in the procedure 'Next Line Segment' and in the procedure 'What'. In the next iteration, it would probably be combined into a single self-contained procedure, with all the subprocedures it needs, and the frame program would be tossed out it has served its purpose as a development tool. program Poly Line; enter a chain of line segments and compute total length stop on double click typepoint record x, y: integer; end; varstop: boolean; length: real; This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License p, q: point; function Eq Points (p, q: point): boolean; begin Eq Points : (p.x q.x) and (p.y q.y) end; function Dist (p, q: point): real; begin Dist : sqrt(sqr(p.x q.x) sqr(p.y q.y)) end; procedure Draw Line (p, q: point; c: Pattern); begin Pen Pat(c); Move To(p.x, p.y); Line To(q.x, q.y) end; procedure Wait For Click;
