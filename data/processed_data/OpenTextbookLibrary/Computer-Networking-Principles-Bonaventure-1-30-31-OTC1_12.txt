must either place the letter at a Post Of ce or inside one of the dedicated mailboxes. The letter will then be collected and delivered to its nal recipient. Note that for the regular service the Post usually does not guarantee the delivery of each particular letter, some letters may be lost, and some letters are delivered to the wrong mailbox. If a letter is important, then the sender can use the registered service to ensure that the letter will be delivered to its recipient. Some Post services also provide an acknowledged service or an express mail service that is faster than the regular service. In computer networks, the notion of service is more formally de ned in X200 . It can be better understood by considering a computer network, whatever its size or complexity, as a black box that provides a service to users , as shown in the gure below. These users could be human users or processes running on a computer system. Many users can be attached to the same service provider. Through this provider, each user must be able to exchange messages with any other user. To be able to deliver these messages, the service provider must be able to unambiguously identify each user. In computer networks, each user is identi ed by a unique address, we will discuss later how these addresses are built and used. At this point, and when considering unicast transmission, the main characteristic of these addresses is that they are unique. Two different users attached to the network cannot use the same address. .
