question, given the always-rapid changes in the eld of computer graphics.) I ha ve tried to make the book suitable for self-learning as well. A reader of this book should have substantial experience wit h at least one programming language, including some knowledge of object-oriented pro gramming and data structures. Everyone taking my own computer graphics course had at least two semesters of programming, and most had additional experience beyond that. My students studied the Java programming language, but the book should also be accessible to people wi th background in other languages. Examples in the book use Java Script, Java, and C. It is possib le to do all the programming in Java Script, but some knowledge of C is also important for cer tain sections of the book. The essential features of the three programming languages are c overed in an appendix. (If you need to learn programming from the beginning, try my free introdu ctory Java textbook, which is available at http: math.hws.edu javanotes .) Iused Version1.0ofthisbookforacoursein Fall2015. Versi on1.1correctedsomeerrorsand typos and added some material. It was used in the Fall 2017 ver sion of my course. Version , which I used in Fall 2021, added some material on Web GL and GLSL ES , updated most of the Java Script code to use ES6, and updated Chapter to use Release of the three.js library. Although I have retired from teaching, I decided to work on Ve rsion in Summer 2023. I added a new chapter on Web GPU and moved to Release for three.js. Because Web GPU uses Java Script promises, I added a new section to Appendix A to cover promises and async functions. Because
