send information over a wireless channel and there is lot of innovation in this eld with new techniques appearing every year. While most wireless networks rely on radio signals, some use a laser that sends light pulses to a remote detector. These optical techniques allow to create point-to-point links while radio-based techniques, depending on the directionality of the antennas, can be used to build networks containing devices spread over a small geographical area. An important point to note about the Physical layer is the service that it provides. This service is usually an unreliable connection-oriented service that allows the users of the Physical layer to exchange bits. The unit of information transfer in the Physical layer is the bit. The Physical layer service is unreliable because : the Physical layer may change, e.g. due to electromagnetic interferences, the value of a bit being transmitted the Physical layer may deliver more bits to the receiver than the bits sent by the sender the Physical layer may deliver fewer bits to the receiver than the bits sent by the sender The last two points may seem strange at rst glance. When two devices are attached through a cable, how is it possible for bits to be created or lost on such a cable ? This is mainly due to the fact that the communicating devices use their own clock to transmit bits at a given bit rate. Consider a sender having a clock that ticks one million times per second and sends one bit every tick. Every microsecond, the sender sends an electrical or optical signal that encodes one bit. The sender s bit rate is thus Mbps. If the receiver clock
