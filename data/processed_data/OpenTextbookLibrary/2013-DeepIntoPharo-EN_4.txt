The fourth part covers advanced topics of the language, in particular exception, blocks and numbers. The fth and last part is about tooling, including pro ling and parsing. Pharo is supported by a strong community that grows daily. Pharo s community is active, innovative, and is always pushing limits of software engineering. The Pharo community consists of software engineering software, casual programmers but also high-level consultants, researchers, and teachers. This book exists because of the Pharo community and we naturally dedicate this book to this group of people that many of us consider as our second family.
