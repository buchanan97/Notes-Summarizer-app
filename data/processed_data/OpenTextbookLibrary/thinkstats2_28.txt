sometimes used interchangeably, but I make this distinction: The mean" of a sample is the summary statistic computed with the previous formula. An average" is one of several summary statistics you might choose to describe a central tendency. Chapter . Distributions Sometimes the mean is a good description of a set of values. For example, apples are all pretty much the same size (at least the ones sold in supermarkets). So if I buy apples and the total weight is pounds, it would be a reasonable summary to say they are about a half pound each. But pumpkins are more diverse. Suppose I grow several varieties in my garden, and one day I harvest three decorative pumpkins that are pound each, two pie pumpkins that are pounds each, and one Atlantic Giant pumpkin that weighs pounds. The mean of this sample is pounds, but if I told you The average pumpkin in my garden is pounds," that would be misleading. In this example, there is no meaningful average because there is no typical pumpkin. Variance If there is no single number that summarizes pumpkin weights, we can do a little better with two numbers: mean and variance . Variance is a summary statistic intended to describe the variability or spread of a distribution. The variance of a set of values is S2 n X i(xi x) The termxi xis called the deviation from the mean," so variance is the mean squared deviation. The square root of variance, S, is the standard deviation . If you have prior experience, you might have seen a formula for variance with n in the denominator, rather than n. This statistic is used to estimate
