want by adding up sinusoids, or you could start with a signal that is similar to what you want and modify it. Chapter Non-periodic signals The signals we have worked with so far are periodic, which means that they repeat forever. It also means that the frequency components they contain do not change over time. In this chapter, we consider non-periodic signals, whose frequency components dochange over time. In other words, pretty much all sound signals. This chapter also presents spectrograms, a common way to visualize nonperiodic signals. The code for this chapter is in chap03.ipynb , which is in the repository for this book (see Section ). You can also view it at http: tinyurl.com thinkdsp03 . Linear chirp We'll start with a chirp , which is a signal with variable frequency. thinkdsp provides a Signal called Chirp that makes a sinusoid that sweeps linearly through a range of frequencies. Here's an example that sweeps from to Hz, which is two octaves from A3 to A5: signal thinkdsp.Chirp(start , end ) wave signal.make wave() Figure shows segments of this wave near the beginning, middle, and end. It's clear that the frequency is increasing. Before we go on, let's see how Chirp is implemented. Here is the class de nition: Chapter . Non-periodic signals Time (s) Figure : Chirp waveform near the beginning, middle, and end. class Chirp(Signal): def init (self, start , end , amp ): self.start start self.end end self.amp amp start andendare the frequencies, in Hz, at the start and end of the chirp. ampis amplitude. Here is the function that evaluates the signal: def evaluate(self, ts): freqs np.linspace(self.start, self.end, len(ts)) dts np.diff(ts, prepend ) dphis PI2
