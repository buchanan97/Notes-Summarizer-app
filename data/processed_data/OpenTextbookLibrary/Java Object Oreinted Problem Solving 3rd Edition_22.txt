use both compilation and interpretation in their translation process. Why Java? Originally named Oak after a tree outside the of ce of its developer, James Goslin, Java is a relatively young programming language. It was initially designed by Sun Microsystems in 1991 as a language for embedding programs into electronic consumer devices, such as microwave ovens and home security systems. However, the tremendous popularity of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) led Sun to recast Java as a language for embedding programs into Web-based applications. As you recall, the Internet is a global computer network, and the WWW is that portion of the network that provides multimedia access to a vast range of information. Java has become one of the most important languages for Web and Internet applications. Java has also generated signi cant interest in the business community, where it is has proved to have tremendous commercial potential. In addition to being a useful tool for helping businesses to promote their products and services over the Internet, Java is also a good language for distributing software and providing services to employees and clients on private corporate networks or intranets. Because of its original intended role as a language for programming microprocessors embedded in consumer appliances, Java has been designed with a number of interesting features: Java is object oriented . Object-oriented languages divide programs into separate modules, called objects, that encapsulate the program s data and operations. Thus, object-oriented programming (OOP) and object-oriented design (OOD) refer to a particular way of organizing pro- Object-oriented Languages CHAPTER Computers, Objects, and Java grams, one which is rapidly emerging as the preferred approach for building complex software systems.
