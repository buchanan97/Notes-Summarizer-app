to better facilitate monitoring and maintenance. How - ever, many of these systems were not developed with this level of connectivity in mind, therefore security weaknesses inherent in the older equipment can result in exploits that allow Hacker s to cause real, permanent damage to physical equipment, potentially dis - rupting the utilities we rely on every day. Tehran s uranium enrichment development facilities were targeted in late 2010 by a custom-created virus that focused on equipment used in the refining of nuclear material. The virus would randomly raise or lower the speed of the equipment in a manner that would not create alarms, but enough to strain the equipment. This would lead to equipment failures, after which the replacement hardware would be similarly infected. Eventually discovered, the virus had been running for many months, delaying the project and increasing its costs. This virus was intentionally designed to run in that particular environment and was based on the specific SCADA hardware involved, and in this case was such a sophisticated attack that it is widely believed to have been facilitated by the United States and Israel. Figure Years of Known Cyber Attacks The graph above, from foreignaffairs.com, provides an idea of how prevalent government to government attacks are becoming. We should keep in mind that the ninety-five incidents depicted are only the known, reported incidents, and the true number is likely higher. The Missing Link: An Introduction to Web Development and Programming Chapter Botnets Botnets are not exactly a new threat to the Internet, but they remain one of the most persistent threats to the average user and their computer. The word botnet, an amalgama - tion of the words
