System.out.printlndisplays results on the screen; the nameprintlnstands for print line . Confusingly,printcan mean both display on the screen and send to the printer . In this book, we ll try to say display when we mean output to the screen. Like most statements, the print statement ends with a semicolon (;). Java is case-sensitive , which means that uppercase and lowercase are not the same. In the Hello World program,Systemhas to begin with an uppercase letter;systemand SYSTEMwon t work. Amethodis a named sequence of statements. This program defines one method namedmain: public static void main(String args) The name and format ofmainis special: when the program runs, it starts at the first statement inmainand ends when it finishes the last statement. Later, you will see programs that define more than one method. This program defines a class named Hello. For now, aclassis a collection of methods; we ll have more to say about this later. You can give a class any name you like, but it is conventional to start with a capital letter. The name of the class has to match the name of the file it is in, so this class has to be in a file named Hello.java. Java uses curly braces ( and ) to group things together. In Hello.java, the outermost braces contain the class definition, and the inner braces contain the method definition. The line that begins with two slashes ( ) is acomment, which is a bit of English text that explains the code. When Java sees , it ignores everything from there until the end of the line. Comments have no effect on the execution oftheprogram, buttheymakeiteasierforotherprogrammers(andyourfuture self) to understand what you meant
