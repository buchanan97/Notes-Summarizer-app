is the norm for most math functions. Plain floats are sometimes referred to as singles (that is, single precision versus double precision). If you don t know the size of a particular data item (for example an int might be either or bits depending on the hardware and compiler), you can use the sizeof() command. This looks like a function but it s really built into the language. The argument is the item or expression you re interested in. It returns the size required in bytes. size sizeof( int ); size will be either or depending on the system. In some systems bit doubles and or bit integers are also available. Embedded Controllers More Math OK, so what happens if you add or multiply two short int together and the result is more than bits long? You wind up with an overrange condition. Note that the compiler cannot warn you of this because whether or not this happens will depend entirely on values entered by the user and subsequently computed within the program. Hopefully, you will always consider maximum value cases and choose appropriate data sizes and this won t be a problem. But what actually happens? To put it simply, the top most bits will be ignored. Consider an bit unsigned integer. It goes from to . is represented as eight 1s. What happens if you add the value to this? You get a bit number: a followed by eight 0s. That ninth bit is thrown away as the variable only has eight bits. Thus, plus equals ! This can create some serious problems! For example, suppose you wanted to use this variable as a loop counter. You want
