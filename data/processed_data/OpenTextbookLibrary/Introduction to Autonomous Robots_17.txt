mountains or a cave; consequently, wheeled robots perform poorly in such environments, whereas legged robots can shine. Can you find examples of robots from the above categories (legged vs wheeled robots)? Identify the different types of actuators that are used in them. Most mechanisms capable of locomotion can also be used for manipulation with only minor modifications. Most industrial manipulators consist of a chain of rotary (or revolute) actuators that are connected by rigid links. In general, they are equipped with six or more independently rotating axes we will see why further down below. In addition, modern industrial manipulators have the ability to not only control the position of each of its joints, but to also control the torque at each individual joint; this capability allows . Locomotion and manipulation examples Figure . Power consumption vs. speed for various means of locomotion. From Todd (1985). . Locomotion, manipulation and their representations control over the compliance of a robot, which in a mechanical sense is the inverse of stiffness. Finally, for dexterous manipulation a robot does not only need an arm, but also a gripper or hand. Grasping is a hard problem on its own and is therefore treated in its own chapter (Chapter ). Regardless of whether the robot is rolling or walking, the dominant actuator type is rotational. Another type of mechanism is the prismatic or linear joint (see Figure for example) that allows the robot to extend and contract a link. This type of joints are usually combined with rotating joints and allow, for example, a robot arm to move up and down, or a robotic walker to extend or retract its leg. . Static and dynamic stability
