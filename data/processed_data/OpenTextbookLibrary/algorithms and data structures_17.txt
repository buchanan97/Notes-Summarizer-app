serves for erasing. The result of drawing also depends critically on the transfer mode 'pn Mode', whose values include 'pat Copy', 'pat Or', and 'pat Xor'. A transfer mode is a boolean operation executed in parallel on each pair of pixels in corresponding positions, one on the screen and one in the pen pattern. 'pat Copy' uses the pattern pixel to overwrite the screen pixel, ignoring the latter's previous value; it is the default and most frequently used transfer mode. 'pat Or' paints a black pixel if either or both the screen pixel or the pattern pixel were black; it progressively blackens the screen. Algorithms and Data Structures A Global Text . Graphics primitives and environments 'pat Xor' (exclusive-or, also known as "odd parity") sets the result to black iff exactly one of (screen pixel, pattern pixel) is black. A white pixel in the pen leaves the underlying screen pixel unchanged; a black pixel complements it. Thus a black pen inverts the screen. 'pn Mode' is set by calling the predefined 'procedure Pen Mode(mode: integer)' e.g. 'Pen Mode(pat Xor)' . The meaning of the remaining predefined procedures our examples use, such as 'Move To' and 'Line To', is easily guessed. So we terminate our peep into some key details of a powerful graphics package, and turn to examples of its use. A graphics frame program Reusable software is a time saving concept that can be practiced profitably in the small. We keep a program that contains nothing but a few of the most useful input output procedures, displays samples of their results, and conducts a minimal dialog so that the user can step through its execution. We call this a
