sequence of instructions to directly execute. However, from the application programmer's standpoint, the low-level details would have been successfully hidden. To summarize this argument, a library of input output routines is not the same as an operating system, because it satis es only the rst part of my de nition. It does use underlying hardware to support the execution of other software. However, it does not provide support for controlled interaction between computations. In fairness to the alternative viewpoint, it is the more historically grounded one. Originally, a piece of software could be called an operating system without supporting controlled interaction. However, the language has evolved such that my de nition more closely re ects current usage. I should also address one other alternative view of operating systems, because it is likely to be the view you have formed from your own experience using general-purpose computers. You are likely to think of an operating system as the software with which you interact in order to carry out tasks such as running application programs. Depending on the user interface to which you are accustomed, you might think the operating system is what allows you to click program icons to run them, or you might think the operating system is what interprets commands you type. . WHAT IS AN OPERATING SYSTEM? There is an element of truth to this perception. The operating system does provide the service of executing a selected application program. However, the operating system provides this service not to human users clicking icons or typing commands, but to other programs already running on the computer, including the one that handles icon clicks or command entries. The operating system allows
