In Ratslife, two miniature robots compete on searching for four feeders that are hidden in a maze. Once a robot reaches a feeder, it receives energy to go on for another seconds, and the feeder becomes temporarily unavailable. After a short while, the feeder becomes available again. The feeders can be either controlled by a referee who also takes care of time-keeping or constructed as part of a simple curriculum on electronics or mechatronics. It should be clear by now how youmight solve these tasks using your abilities, and you may have also thought about some fall-back strategies in case a sensor or two of yours were unavailable. Here are some possible algorithms for a robot, ordered by increasingly sophisticated capabilities the robot might wield: . Ratslife: an example of autonomous mobile robotics Figure . A simple maze made from cardboard, wood, or Lego bricks with one or more charging stations. Locations in the maze are marked with unique markers that can be recognized by a simple robot. Imagine you have a robot that can only drive (actuation) and bounce off a wall. The resulting random walk will eventually let the robot reach a feeder. As the allowed time to do so is limited, it is likely that the robot s energy will soon deplete. Now imagine a robot that has a sensor that gives it the ability to estimate its distance from a wall. This could be a whisker, an infrared distance sensor, an ultrasound distance sensor, or a laser range finder. The robot could now use this sensor to keep following a wall to its right. Using this strategy for solving the maze, it will eventually explore the
