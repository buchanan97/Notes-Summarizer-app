. Given a Hist, we can make a dictionary that maps from each value to its probability: n hist.Total() d for x, freq in hist.Items(): d x freq n Or we can use the Pmf class provided by thinkstats2 . Like Hist, the Pmf constructor can take a list, pandas Series, dictionary, Hist, or another Pmf object. Here's an example with a simple list: Chapter . Probability mass functions import thinkstats2 pmf thinkstats2.Pmf( , , , , ) pmf Pmf( : , : , : , : ) The Pmf is normalized so total probability is . Pmf and Hist objects are similar in many ways; in fact, they inherit many of their methods from a common parent class. For example, the methods Values and Items work the same way for both. The biggest di erence is that a Hist maps from values to integer counters; a Pmf maps from values to oating-point probabilities. To look up the probability associated with a value, use Prob : pmf.Prob( ) The bracket operator is equivalent: pmf You can modify an existing Pmf by incrementing the probability associated with a value: pmf.Incr( , ) pmf.Prob( ) Or you can multiply a probability by a factor: pmf.Mult( , ) pmf.Prob( ) If you modify a Pmf, the result may not be normalized; that is, the probabilities may no longer add up to . To check, you can call Total , which returns the sum of the probabilities: pmf.Total() . Plotting PMFs To renormalize, call Normalize : pmf.Normalize() pmf.Total() Pmf objects provide a Copy method so you can make and modify a cop
