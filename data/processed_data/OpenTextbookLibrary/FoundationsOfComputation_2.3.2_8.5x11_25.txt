is the ace of clubs. But this is just an example of th e rst distributive law! For, let arepresent the proposition This card is an ace, let srepresent Thiscardisaspade, andlet crepresent Thiscardisaclub. Then Thiscard istheaceofspadesorclubs canbetranslatedintologicas a (s c), while This card is the ace of spades or this card is the ace of clubs becom es (a s) (a c). And the distributive law assures us that a (s c) (a s) (a c). The second distributive law tells us, for example, that This card is ei ther a joker or is the ten of diamonds is logically equivalent to This card is eit her a joker or a ten, and it is either a joker or a diamond. That is, j (t d) (j t) (j d). The distributive laws are powerful tools and you should keep the m in mind whenever you are faced with a mixture of and operators. De Morgan s Laws must also be less than obvious, since people often get them wrong. But they do make sense. When considering (p q), you should ask yourself, how can pandq failto be true. It will fail to be true if either p is falseorifqis false (or both). That is, (p q) is equivalent to ( p) ( q). Consider the sentence A raven is large and black. If a bird i snotlarge and black, then it is not a raven. But what exactly does it mean to b e not (large and black) ? How can you tell whether the assertion not (large and blac k) is true of something? This will be true if it is either not larg eornot black. (It doesn
