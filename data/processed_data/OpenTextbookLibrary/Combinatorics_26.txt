total number of outcomes is comprised of the outcomes that doinclude that event, together with the ones that don t. So if it s easy to figure out how many outcomes include the event that interests you, then you can subtract that from the total number of outcomes to determine how many outcomes exclude that event. Here s an example. EXAMPLE . There are 216different possible outcomes from rolling a white die, a red die, and a yellow die. (You can work this out using the product rule.) How many of these outcomes involve rolling a one on two or fewer of the dice? SOLUTION. Tackling this problem directly, you might be inclined to split it into three cases: outcomes that involve rolling no ones, those that involve rolling exactly one one, and those that involve rolling exactly two ones. If you try this, the analysis will be long and fairly involved, and will include both the product rule and the sum rule. If you are careful, you will be able to find the correct answer this way. We ll use a different approach, by first counting the outcomes that we don t want: those that involve getting a one on all three of the dice. There is only one way for this to happen: all . Basic Counting Techniques three of the dice have to roll ones! So the number of outcomes that involve rolling ones on two or fewer of the dice, will be . EXERCISES . Use only the sum rule to answer the following questions: )I have four markers on my desk: one blue and three black. Every day on my way to class, I grab
