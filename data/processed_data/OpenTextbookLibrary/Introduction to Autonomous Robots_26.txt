apply the same procedure to all three vectors that span coordinate system B and stack these three vectors together into a matrix to obtain the rotation matrix A BR A XBA YBA ZB , ( ) which describes B relative to A . It is important to note that all columns in A BRare unit vectors, so that the rotation matrix is orthonormal. This is important as it allows us to easily obtain the inverse of A BRas A BRTor B AR A BRT. The reason why the unit vectors of a coordinate system B expressed in coordinate system A actually make up a rotation matrix can be easily seen when re-arranging Equation in matrix form: AP px py pz , ( ) where the rotation matrix is the identity as both points already are in the same coordinate system, that is, no rotation is needed. We have now established how to express the orientation of a coordinate system using a rotation matrix. Usually, coordinate systems don t lie on top .

Top: A coordinate system B with position given by APand orientation given by XB, YB, and ZB. Bottom: The projection of the unit vector XB onto the unit vectors that span coordinate system A after moving B into the origin of A . As all vectors are unit vectors, A B A B cos cos . .
