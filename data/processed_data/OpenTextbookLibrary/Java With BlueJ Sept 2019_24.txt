main(String args) c1 and c2 are two char variables char c1 'a'; char c2 'z'; Display c1 and c2 Display true or false according to whether they are equal o r not System.out.println("The char values"); System.out.println(c1); System.out.println(c2); System.out.println("Testing c1 c2"); System.out.println(c1 c2); System.out.println("Testing c1 c2"); System.out.println(c1 c2); System.out.println("Testing c1 c2"); System.out.println(c1 c2); Results of comparing cha r values Exercises . Write a program that will print the integer values for the characters ! , , , , , , , , ( , ) . Note that Java allows a statement such as int value a ; . Since Java uses two bytes of memory there are bits used to represent char values. How many different char values can be represented? Conditiona l Operator ?: The conditional operator is sometimes called the ternary operator as it has three operands. Note the placement of ? and : in its syntax : logical expression ? true value : false value where logical expression is some logic al expression evaluating to true or false true value is the result when the logical expression is true false value is the result when the logical expression is false The conditional operator yields a result that is either true value or false va lue . Example Suppose we want to assign the variable max Value the maximum of two variables, x and y. This is easily done with an assignment statement where the right hand side is coded with the conditional operator, as in: max Value (x y) ? x : y ; This form is often used by programmers for simple cases like the above. In a later chapter we will see the if-else statement
