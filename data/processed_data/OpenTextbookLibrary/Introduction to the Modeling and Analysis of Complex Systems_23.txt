experiment to see if your predictions are actually true. Y es!Y our hypothesis is proven, congratulations. Uncork a champagne bottle and publish a paper. No!Y our hypothesis was wrong, unfortunately. Go back to the lab or the eld, get more data, and develop another hypothesis. Many people think this is how science works. But there is at least one thing that is not quite right in the list above. What is it? Can you gure it out? CHAPTER . FUNDAMENTALS OF MODELING As some of you may know already, the problem exists in the last part, i.e., when the experiment produced a result that matched your predictions. Let s do some logic to better understand what the problem really is. Assume that you observed a phenomenon Pin nature and came up with a hypothesis Hthat can explain P. This means that a logical statement H!Pis always true (because you chose Hthat way). To prove H, you also derived a prediction Qfrom H, i.e., another logical statement H!Qis always true, too. Then you conduct experiments to see if Qcan be actually observed. What if Qis actually observed? Or, what if not Q is observed instead? If not Q is observed, things are easy. Logically speaking, (H!Q)is equivalent to (not Q!not H)because they are contrapositions of each other, i.e., logically identical statements that can be converted from one to another by negating both the condition and the consequence and then ipping their order. This means that, if not Qis true, then it logically proves that not His also true, i.e., your hypothesis is wrong. This argument is clear, and there is no problem with it (aside from the fact that you will
