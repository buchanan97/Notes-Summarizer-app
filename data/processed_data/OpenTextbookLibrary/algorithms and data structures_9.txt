transforming the seven-line program in two steps. If we have the complementary primitive 'if not touch goto ', we can simplify the flow of the program at the left as shown on the right side. wall to left-rear wall to left-rear 1left 1left 2if touch goto 2if not touch goto 3goto wall to right-front wall to right-front 4right 4right This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License 5goto 5goto 6forward 6forward 7goto 7goto An optimization technique called loop rotation allows us to shorten this program by yet another instruction. It changes the structure of the program significantly, as we see from the way the labels have been permuted. The assertion "wall to right-front" attached to line serves as an invariant of the loop "keep turning right while you can't advance". wall to right-front 4right 2if touch goto 6forward 1left 7goto Programming projects .Design a data structure suitable for storing a wall made up of horizontal and vertical line segments in a square grid of bounded size. Write a "wall-editor", i.e. an interactive program that lets the user define and modify an instance of such a wall. .Program the wall-following algorithm and animate its execution when tracking a wall entered with the walleditor. Specifically, show the robot's position and orientation after each change of state. Algorithms and Data Structures A Global Text This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License .
