logic, as discrete mathematics is often used as a gateway course for upper-level math. Elementary number theory and set theory are also sometimes covered. Algorithms are a common topic, as algorithmic techniques tend to work very well on the sorts of structures that we study in discrete mathematics. In Combinatorics, we focus on combinations and arrangements of discrete structures. There are five major branches of combinatorics that we will touch on in this course: enumeration, graph theory, Ramsey Theory, design theory, and coding theory. (The related topic of cryptography can also be studied in combinatorics, but we will not touch on it in this course.) We will focus on enumeration, graph theory, and design theory, but will briefly introduce the other two topics. . Enumeration Enumeration is a big fancy word for counting. If you ve taken a course in probability and statistics, you ve already covered some of the techniques and problems we ll be covering in this course. When a statistician (or other mathematician) is calculating the probability of a particular outcome in circumstances where all outcomes are equally likely, what they usually do is enumerate all possible outcomes, and then figure out how many of these include the outcome they are looking for. EXAMPLE . What is the probability of rolling a 3on a -sided die? SOLUTION. To figure this out, a mathematician would count the sides of the die (there are six) and count how many of those sides display a three (one of them). They would conclude that the probability of rolling a 3on a -sided die is (one in six). . What is Combinatorics? That was an example that you could probably figure out
