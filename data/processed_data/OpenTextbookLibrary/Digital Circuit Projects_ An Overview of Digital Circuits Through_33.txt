D ABC D ABCD ABCD AB C D AB C D AB CD AB CD Note that once again this number has resulted in regions in the K -map where the variables differ by digit, as shown below. Note that the regions B' and D wrap around the table. To use the K -map to solve variable functions, once again groupings of 2n are found, which for a -Variable K -map are ., , , , and . The larger the grouping, the fewer the terms, so groupings of are chosen over groupings of , groupings of are chosen over groupings of , groupings of are chosen over groupings of , and groupings of are chosen over groupings of . The following is an example of how to use a K -map to solve a Boolean expression. Consider a function f(A,B,C) has the following truth table: Input f(A,B,C) A B C D AND DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS This expression can be represented as the following sum of products. f(A,B,C) ( , , , , , , , , , ) The minimum function for this K -map consists of one group of and one group of , and corresponds to the equation f(A,B,C) B C D . Note the cell s A BC'D and ABC D are used in both equations, which is rule from the Boolean relationship table, X X X, and means that any term in the summation can be used more than once in minimizing the circuit. DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS To show that the final equation corresponds to the initial truth table, Boolean algebra can be used. The derivation of the final equation from the DNF
