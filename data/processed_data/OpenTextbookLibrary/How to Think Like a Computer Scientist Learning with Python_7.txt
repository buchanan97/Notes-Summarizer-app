real programming experience than I had would be needed to do it right. The book sat in an un nished state for the better part of a year until the free software community once again provided the needed means for its completion. I received an email from Chris Meyers expressing interest in the book. Chris is a professional programmer who started teaching a programming course last yea r using Python at Lane Community College in Eugene, Oregon. The prospect of teaching the course had led Chris to the book, and he started helping out with it immediately. By the end of the school year he had created a companion project on our website at http: www.ibiblio.org obp called Python for Fun and was working with some of my most advanced students as a master teacher, guiding them beyond where I could take them. Introducing programming with Python The process of translating and using How to Think Like a Computer Scientist for the past two years has con rmed Python s suitability for teaching beginning students. Python greatly simpli es programming examples and makes importan t programming ideas easier to teach. The rst example from the text illustrates this point. It is the traditiona l hello, world program, which in the C version of the book looks like this: include iostream.h void main() cout "Hello, world." endl; in the Python version it becomes: print "Hello, World!" Even though this is a trivial example, the advantages of Python stand out. Yo rktown s Computer Science I course has no prerequisites, so many of the students x Preface seeing this example are looking at their rst program. Some of them are undoubtedly a
