what point you are talking about. Row and column numbers identify a pixel, not a point. A pixel c ontains many points; mathematically, it contains an in nite number of points. Th e goal of computer graphics is not really to color pixels it is to create and manipulate images . In some ideal sense, an image should be de ned by specifying a color for each point, not jus t for each pixel. Pixels are an approximation. If we imagine that there is a true, ideal imag e that we want to display, then any image that we display by coloring pixels is an approximat ion. This has many implications. Suppose, for example, that we want to draw a line segment. A ma thematical line has no thickness and would be invisible. So we really want to draw a t hick line segment, with some speci ed width. Let s say that the line should be one pixel wi de. The problem is that, unless the line is horizontal or vertical, we can t actually draw th e line by coloring pixels. A diagonal geometric line will cover some pixels only partially. It is n ot possible to make part of a pixel black and part of it white. When you try to draw a line with blac k and white pixels only, the result is a jagged staircase e ect. This e ect is an examp le of something called aliasing. Aliasing can also be seen in the outlines of characters drawn on the screen and in diagonal or curved boundaries between any two regions of di erent color . (The term aliasing likely comes from the fact
