One thing that students often get confused is the difference between a named stringvariableand that of an (unnamed) stringvalue. Consider the difference in outputs of the following: slang 'lit' len(slang) len('slang') In the first example, we asked how long is the value being held in theslangvariable? The answer was , since lit is three characters long. In the second example, we asked how long is the word'slang'? and the answer is . Remember: variable names never go in quotes. If something is in quotes, it s being takenliterally. CHAPTER . THREE KINDS OF ATOMIC DATA Combining and printing variables There s a whole lot of stuff you can do with variables other than just creating them. One thing you ll want to do frequently isprint a variable, which means to dump its value to the page so you can see it. This is easily done by calling theprint()function: print(donut store) print(price of Christian Louboutin shoes) print("slang") print(slang) Paul's Bakery slang lit Again, don t miss the crucial difference between printing"slang" and printingslang.

There are several ways to accomplish this, but the most flexible will turn out to be the.format()method. I hate to hit you with so much new lingo. Amethodis very similar
