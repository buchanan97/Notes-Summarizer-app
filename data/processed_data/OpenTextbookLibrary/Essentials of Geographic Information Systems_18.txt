Is it computer software? Is it a collection of computer hardware? I s it a service that is distributed and accessed via the Internet? Is it a tool? Is it a system? Is it a science? The answer to all these questions is, GIS is all of the above and more. From a software perspective, a GIS consists of a special type of comp uter program capable of storing, editing, processing, and presenting geographic data and information as maps. There are several GIS software providers, such as Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc. ( http: www.esri.com ), which distributes Arc GIS, and Pitney Bowes ( http: www.pbinsight.com ), which distributes Map Info GIS. Though online mapping services and interfaces are provided by companies like Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, such services are not (yet) considered fully fledged GIS platforms. There are also open -source GIS options, such as GRASS ( http: grass.itc.it ), which is freely distributed and maintained by the opensource community. All GIS software, regardless of vendor, consists of a database management system that is capable of handling and integrating two types of data: spatial data and attribute data. Spatial data refer to the real -world geographic objects of interest, such as streets, buildings, lakes, and countries, and their respective locations. In addition to location, each of these objects also possesses certain traits of interest, or attributes, such as a name, number of stories, de pth, or population. GIS software keeps track of both the spatial and attribute data and permits us to link the two types of data together to create information and facilitate analysis.
