Preface Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org courses cs402 The Saylor Foundation CHAPTER Introduction When the rst computers were built during the second world war, they were expensive and isolated. However, after about twenty years, as their prices gradually decreased, the rst experiments began to connect computers together. In the early 1960s, researchers including Paul Baran, Donald Davies or Joseph Licklider independently published the rst papers describing the idea of building computer networks Baran Licklider1963 . Given the cost of computers, sharing them over a long distance was an interesting idea. In the US, the ARPANET started in 1969 and continued until the mid 1980s LCCD09 . In France, Louis Pouzin developed the Cyclades network Pouzin1975 . Many other research networks were built during the 1970s Moore . At the same time, the telecommunication and computer industries became interested in computer networks. The telecommunication industry bet on the X25. The computer industry took a completely different approach by designing Local Area Networks (LAN). Many LAN technologies such as Ethernet or Token Ring were designed at that time. During the 1980s, the need to interconnect more and more computers led most computer vendors to develop their own suite of networking protocols. Xerox developed XNS , DEC chose DECNet Malamud1991 , IBM developed SNA Mc Fadyen1976 , Microsoft introduced Net BIOS
