modeling . The starting point is to construct an arti cial D world as a collection of simple geometric shapes, arranged in three-dimensional space. The objects c an have attributes that, combined with global properties of the world, determine the appearan ce of the objects. Often, the range of basic shapes is very limited, perhaps including only poin ts, line segments, and triangles. A CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION more complex shape such as a polygon or sphere can be built or a pproximated as a collection of more basic shapes, if it is not itself considered to be basi c. To make a two-dimensional image of the scene, the scene is projected from three dimensions do wn to two dimensions. Projection is the equivalent of taking a photograph of the scene. Let s l ook at how it all works in a little more detail. First, the geometry We start with an empty D space or world. Of course, this space exists only conceptually, but it s useful to think of i t as real and to be able to visualize it in your mind. The space needs a coordinate system that associ ates each point in the space with three numbers, usually referred to as the x,y, andzcoordinates of the point. This coordinate system is referred to as world coordinates. We want to build a scene inside the world, made up of geometric objects. For example, we can specify a line segment in the scene by giving the coordi nates of its two endpoints, and we can specify a triangle by giving the coordinates of its three vertices. The smallest building blocks that we have to work with, such as
