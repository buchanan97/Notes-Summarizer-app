one program that is running to start another program running. This is just one of the many services the operating system provides to running programs. Another example service is writing output into a le. The sum total of features the operating system makes available for application programmers to use in their programs is called the Application Programming Interface (API). One element of the API is the ability to run other programs. The reason why you can click a program icon or type in a command to run a program is that general-purpose operating systems come bundled with a user-interface program, which uses the operating system API to run other programs in response to mouse or keyboard input. At a marketing level, this user-interface program may be treated as a part of the operating system; it may not be given a prominent name of its own and may not be available for separate purchase. For example, Microsoft Windows comes with a user interface known as File Explorer, which provides features such as the Start menu and the ability to click icons. (This program was named Windows Explorer prior to Windows .) However, even if you are an experienced Windows user, you may never have heard of File Explorer; Microsoft has chosen to give it a very low pro le, treating it as an integral part of the Microsoft Windows environment. At a technical level, however, it is distinct from the operating system proper. In order to make the distinction explicit, the true operating system is often called the kernel . The kernel is the fundamental portion of Microsoft Windows that provides an API supporting computations with controlled interactions. A similar distinction
