Input devices bring data and information into the computer. Some of the more common input devices are the keyboard, mouse, microphone, and scanner. Primary memory ormain memory of a computer is used to store both data and programs. This type of memory, which is often called RAM , short for Random Access Memory , is built entirely out of electronic components integrated circuit chips which makes it extremely fast. A computer s main memory is volatile , which means that any information stored in it is lost when the computer s power is turned off. In a sense, main memory acts as the computer s scratch pad, storing both programs and data temporarily while a program is running. Secondary storage devices are used for long-term or permanent storage of relatively large amounts of information. These devices include hard drives or magnetic disks, compact disks (CDs), digital video disks (DVDs), and magnetic tapes. All of these devices are non-volatile , meaning that they retain information when the computer s power is turned off. Compared to a computer s primary memory, these devices are relatively slow. The central processing unit (CPU) is the computer s main engine. The CPU is the computer s microprocessor , such as the Intel Pentium processor, which serves as the foundation for most Windows PCs, or the Power-PC processor, which serves as the foundation for Macintosh computers. The CPU is designed to perform the fetch-execute cycle ,Fetch-execute cycle whereby it repeatedly gets the next machine instruction from memory and executes it. Under the direction
