extensively are coded with this style: not actually modifying the variables they are passed, but instead returning to you a modified copy which you must store. Now given that this is the case, it would at least be nice if I could tell you that it always, consistently worked this way. Then you could simply accept it and get used to it. Alas, no. Thereare functions methods (lots of them) whichdomodify a parameter or the variable they were called on. So sometimes, our na ve approach ofcallingthemethodandexpectingthevariabletochangeisexactly what we need to do. The bottom line is:there s no way of knowing without being told, or else reading the documentation.We ll learn how to do the latter in a future chapter. For now, I m simply telling you for the record that the methods in Figure are all of the return a modified copy type, and giving you a heads up that both styles of method do exist out there in abundance. A couple more things. First, as a corollary of the above, realize that the following statement (on a line by itself) is officially useless: name of pet.lstrip() You called the.lstrip()method, and then did nothing with the returnvalue. Ifyoudon tstoreitinavariable orelsedosomething with it right away likeprintit before it slips out of your fingers it s irrevocably lost: it doesn t even show up on the memory picture because there s no variable name. (Think about that.) Second, note the following pattern which is very often used: CHAPTER . CALCULATIONS name of pet name of pet.lstrip() Here, we re calling.lstrip()on thename of petvariableand then storing the return value back in thename of petvariable. This might be what you thought would have
