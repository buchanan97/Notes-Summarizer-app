According to the proof of the theorem, this row corresponds to the conjunction ( p q r). This conjunction is true when pis false,qis false, andris true; in all other cases it is false, since in any other case at least one of the terms p, q, orris false. The other two rows where the output is true give two more conjunctions. The three conjunctions are comb ined to produce the DNF proposition ( p q r) ( p q r) (p q r). This proposition computes all the output values speci ed in the table. Using t his proposition as a blueprint, we get a logic circuit whose outputs match those given in the table. Now, given any combinatorial logic circuit, there are many o ther circuits that have the same input output behavior. When two circuits have the same CHAPTER .

The disjunction of these conjunctio ns is a proposition whose output values are precisely those speci ed by the table. input output table, the compound propositions associated with the two circuits are logically equivalent. To put this another way, proposit ions that are logically equivalent produce circuits that have the same
