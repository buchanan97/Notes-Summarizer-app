of sem aphores is available as part of the programming language or the operating sys tem. Di erent implementations sometimes o er slightly di erent capabil ities, and usually require di erent syntax. In this book I will use a simple pseudo-language to demonstra te how semaphores work. The syntax for creating a new semaphore and initializing it is Semaphore initialization syntax 1fred Semaphore( ) The function Semaphore is a constructor; it creates and returns a new Semaphore. The initial value of the semaphore is passed as a p arameter to the constructor. The semaphore operations go by di erent names in di erent en vironments. The most common alternatives are Semaphore operations 1fred.increment() 2fred.decrement() and Semaphore operations 1fred.signal() 2fred.wait() and Why semaphores? Semaphore operations 1fred.V() 2fred.P() It may be surprising that there are so many names, but there is a reason. increment anddecrement describe what the operations do.signalandwait describe what they are often used for. And Vand Pwere the original names proposed by Dijkstra, who wisely realized that a meaningles s name is better than a misleading name1. I consider the other pairs misleading because increment anddecrement neglect to mention the possibility of blocking and waking, a nd semaphores are often used in ways that have nothing to do with signalandwait. If you insist on meaningful names, then I would suggest these : Semaphore operations 1fred.increment and wake a waiting process if any() 2fred.decrement and block if the result is negative( ) I don t think the world is likely to embrace either of these na mes soon. In the meantime, I choose (more or less arbitrarily) to use signalandwait. Why semaphores? Lookingatthede nitionofsemaphores, itisnotatallobvio uswhytheyareuseful. It s true
