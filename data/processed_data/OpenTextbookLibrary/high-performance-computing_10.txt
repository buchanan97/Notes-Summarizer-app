book). Some people claim we eventually will have single CPUs so fast we won t need to understand any type of advanced architectures that require some skill to program. So far in this field of computing, even as performance of a single inexpensive microprocessor has increased over a thousandfold, there seems to be no less interest in lashing a thousand of these processors together to get a millionfold increase in power . The cheaper the building blocks of high performance computing become, the greater the benefit for using many processors. If at some point in the future, we have a single processor that is faster than any of the -processor scalable systems of today , think how much we could do when we connect of those new processors together in a single system. That s what this book is all about. If you re interested, read on. Introduction Memory Let s say that you are fast asleep some night and begin dreaming. In your dream, you have a time machine and a few -MHz four -way superscalar processors. Y ou turn the time machine back to 1981. Once you arrive back in time, you go out and purchase an IBM PC with an Intel 8088 microprocessor running at MHz. For much of the rest of the night, you toss and turn as you try to adapt the -MHz processor to the Intel 8088 socket using a soldering iron and Swiss Army knife. Just before you wake up, the new computer finally works, and you turn it on to run the Linpack footnote benchmark and issue a press release. W ould you expect this to turn out to be a dream
