gure has three inputs, labeled A,B, and C. The circuit computes the value of the compound proposition ( A) (B (A C)). That is, when Arepresents the proposition the input wire labeled Ais on, and similarly for Band C, then the output of the circuit is on if and only if the value of the compound proposition ( A) (B (A C)) is true. Given any compound proposition made from the operators , , and , it is possible to build a logic circuit that computes the value o f that proposition. The proposition itself is a blueprint for the circuit. As not ed in Section , every logical operator that we have encountered can be expre ssed in terms of CHAPTER . LOGIC AND PROOF , , and , so in fact every compound proposition that we know how to wri te can be computed by a logic circuit. Given a proposition constructed from , , and operators, it is easy to build a circuit to compute it. First, identify the main ope rator in the proposition the one whose value will be computed last. Consider ( A B) (A B). This circuit has two input values, Aand B, which are represented by wires coming into the circuit. The circuit has an output wire that represents the computed value of the proposition. The main operator in ( A B) (A B), is the rst , which computes the value of the expression as a whole by combining the values of the subexpressions A Band (A B). This operator corresponds to an andgate in the circuit that computes the nal output of the circuit. Once the main operator has been
