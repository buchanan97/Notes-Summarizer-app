character returns its corresponding le reference ( e.g.,' tmp' as File Reference ) Files with File System Creating a le and writing in it is as simple as: (File System disk working Directory 'foo.txt') write Stream Do: :stream stream next Put All: 'Hello World' . File Locator is a late binding reference, useful when the le location in a hard disk depends on the running context. File System Directory Entry offers a large set of low level detail for a given le. Chapter Sockets written by: Noury Bouraqadi (Noury.Bouraqadi mines-douai.fr) Luc Fabresse (Luc.Fabresse mines-douai.fr) Modern software often involve multiple devices that collaborate through a network. The basic approach to set up such collaborations is to use sockets. A typical use is in the World Wide Web. Browsers and servers interact through sockets that carry HTTP requests and responses. The concept of socket was rst introduced by researchers from University of Berkeley in the 1960s. They de ned the rst socket API for the C programming language in the context of Unix operating systems. Since then, the concept of socket spread out to other operating systems. Its API was ported to almost all programming languages. In this chapter, we present the API of sockets in the context of Pharo. We rst show through some examples how to use sockets for building both clients and servers. The notion of client and server are inherent in sockets: a server waits for requests emitted by clients. Then, we introduce Socket Stream and how to use it. In practice, one is likely to use Socket Stream instead of plain sockets. The chapter ends with a description of some unix networking utilities that are useful for
