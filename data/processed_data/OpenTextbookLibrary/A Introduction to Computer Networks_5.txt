me three years to get the html quick-search facility to work again after I broke it with the collapsible sidebar. See Technical considerations below for more information. Second Edition The second edition is nally here! Mainly this involved breaking up the longer chapters, partly to make scrolling less fussy (at least on some devices), partly to restore the sense of accomplishment at nishing a chapter, and partly so the collabsible contents sidebar ts in the viewport of most devices, making sidebar scrolling unnecessary. Division of the overlong chapters in many cases followed a logical divide: thus the IPv4 chapter became the basic IPv4 chapter and the IPv4 companion protocols, the Ethernet chapter became a chapter on basic Ethernet and a chapter on more advanced features, and the security chapter divided naturally into public-key encryption for the second half, and everything else in the rst half. An Introduction to Computer Networks, Release In other cases, the division was less natural; the IPv6 chapters comes to mind here as the companion protocols Neighbor Discovery, DHCPv6 and SLAAC ended up in the same chapter as the IPv6 core protocol. Throughout the eight-year lifetime of the rst edition, I never changed any exercise numbers; new exercises that needed to be grouped with older exercises were always inserted with oating-point numbering, eg4. . For a book that might get updated in the middle of the semester, that is essential. However, the second edition involved splitting chapters and dividing the exercises appropriately, and I realized that the time for renumbering was at hand. To make life easier for instructors (including me) who have assignments based on the old numbering, there is a handy conversion table here:
