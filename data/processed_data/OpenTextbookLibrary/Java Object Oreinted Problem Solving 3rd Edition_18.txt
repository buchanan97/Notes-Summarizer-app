SECTION Programming Languages One of the best reasons to study programming is because it is a creative and enjoyable problem-solving activity. This book will teach you to develop well-designed solutions to a range of interesting problems. One of the best things about programming is that you can actually see and experience your solutions as running programs. As many students have indicated, there s really nothing like the kick you get from seeing your program solving a problem you ve been struggling with. Designing and building well-written programs provides a powerful sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. What s more, Java is a language that makes programming even more fun, because once they re nished, many Java programs can be posted on the World Wide Web (WWW) for all the world to see! Programming Languages Most computer programs today are written in a high-level language , such as Java, C, C , or FORTRAN. A programming language is considered high level if its statements resemble English-language statements. For example, all of the languages just mentioned have some form of an if statement, which says, if some condition holds, then take some action. Computer scientists have invented hundreds of high-level programming languages, although relatively few of these have been put to practical use. Some of the widely used languages have special features that make them suitable for one type of programming application or another. COBOL (COmmon Business-Oriented Language), for example, is still widely used in commercial applications. FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslator) is still preferred by some engineers and scientists. C and C are still the primary languages used by operating system programmers. In addition to having features that make them suitable for certain types
