The examples and supporting code for this book are in Python. You should know core Python and be familiar with its object-oriented features, speci cally using and de ning classes. Changes from the rst edition xiii If you are not already familiar with Python, you might want to start with Think Python , which is appropriate for people who have never programmed before. If you have programming experience in another language, there are many good Python books to choose from, as well as online resources. I use Num Py, Sci Py, and Network X throughout the book. If you are familiar with these libraries already, that's great, but I will also explain them when they appear. I assume that the reader knows some mathematics: I use logarithms in several places, and vectors in one example. But that's about it. Changes from the rst edition For the second edition, I added two chapters, one on evolution, the other on the evolution of cooperation. In the rst edition, each chapter presented background on a topic and suggested experiments the reader could run. For the second edition, I have done those experiments. Each chapter presents the implementation and results as a worked example, then suggests additional experiments for the reader. For the second edition, I replaced some of my own code with standard libraries like Num Py and Network X. The result is more concise and more e cient, and it gives readers a chance to learn these libraries. Also, the Jupyter
