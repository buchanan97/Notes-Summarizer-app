is connected. Connected graphs A graph is connected if there is a path from every node to every other node (see http: thinkcomplex.com conn ). For many applications involving graphs, it is useful to check whether a graph is connected. Fortunately, there is a simple algorithm that does it. You can start at any node and check whether you can reach all other nodes. If you can reach a node, v, you can reach any of the neighbors ofv, which are the nodes connected to vby an edge. The Graph class provides a method called neighbors that returns a list of neighbors for a given node. For example, in the complete graph we generated in the previous section: complete.neighbors( ) , , , , , , , , Suppose we start at node s. We can mark sas seen" and mark its neighbors. Then we mark the neighbor's neighbors, and their neighbors, and so on, until we can't reach any more nodes. If all nodes are seen, the graph is connected. Here's what that looks like in Python: Connected graphs def reachable nodes(G, start): seen set() stack start while stack: node stack.pop() if node not in seen: seen.add(node) stack.extend(G.neighbors(node)) return seen reachable nodes takes a Graph and a starting node, start , and returns the set of nodes that can be reached from start . Initially the set, seen , is empty, and we create a list called stack that keeps track of nodes we have discovered but not yet processed. Initially the stack contains a single node, start . Now, each time through the loop, we: . Remove one node from the stack. . If the node is already
