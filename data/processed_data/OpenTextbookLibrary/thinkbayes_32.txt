The co de in this section is a v ailable from http: thinkbayes.com monty.py . F or more information see Section . Encapsulating the framew ork No w that w e see what elemen ts of the framew ork are the same, w e can encapsulate them in an ob ject a Suite is a Pmf that pro vides init , Update , and Print : class Suite(Pmf): """Represents a suite of hypotheses and their probabilities.""" def init (self, hypo tuple()): """Initializes the distribution.""" def Update(self, data): """Updates each hypothesis based on the data.""" def Print(self): """Prints the hypotheses and their probabilities.""" The implemen tation of Suite is in thinkbayes.py . T o use Suite , y ou should write a class that inherits from it and pro vides Likelihood . F or example, here is the solution to the Mon t y Hall problem rewritten to use Suite : from thinkbayes import Suite class Monty(Suite): def Likelihood(self, data, hypo): if hypo data: return elif hypo ' A ' : return else: return And here's the co de that uses this class: suite Monty( ' ABC ' ) suite.Update( ' B ' ) suite.Print() Y ou can do wnload this example from http: thinkbayes.com monty2.py .
