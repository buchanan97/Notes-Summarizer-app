number of objects, including a vast amount of pre-existing code and programming tools (all of which are objects). As you work with Pharo, you will send messages to these objects, you will create new objects, and some of these objects will die and their memory will be reclaimed (garbage-collected). When you quit Pharo, you will normally save a snapshot that contains all of your objects. If you save normally, you will overwrite your old image file with the new snapshot. Alternatively, you may save the image under a new name. As mentioned earlier, in addition to the .image file, there is also a .changes file. This file contains a log of all the changes to the source code that you have made using the standard tools. Most of the time you do not need to Aquicktourof Pharo worry about this file at all. As we shall see, however, the .changes file can be very useful for recovering from errors, or replaying lost changes. More about this later! It may seem like the image is the key mechanism for storing and managing software projects, but that is not the case. As we shall see soon, there are much better tools for managing code and sharing software developed by teams. Images are very useful, but you should learn to be very cavalier about creating and throwing away images, since versioning tools like Monticello offer much better ways to manage versions and share code amongst developers. In addition, if you need to persist objects, you can use several systems such as Fuel(a fast object binary serializer), STON(a textual object serializer) or a database.
