to a set of recipients. It was rst used in LANs but later became supported in wide area networks. When a sender uses multicast to send information to Nreceivers, the sender sends a single copy of the information and the network nodes duplicate this information whenever necessary, so that it can reach all recipients belonging to the destination group. To understand the importance of multicast transmission, consider source Sthat sends the same information to destinations A,Cand E. With unicast, the same information passes three times on intermediate nodes 1and2and twice on node . This is a waste of resources on the intermediate nodes and on the links between them. With multicast transmission, host Ssends the information to node 1that forwards it downstream to node . This node creates a copy of the received information and sends one copy directly to host Eand the other downstream to node . Upon reception of the information, node 4produces a copy and forwards one to node Aand another to node C. Thanks to multicast, the same information can reach a large number of receivers while being sent only once on each link.

It was initially de ned in RFC 1542. In this transmission mode, a set of receivers is identi ed. When a source sends information towards this set of receivers, the network ensures
