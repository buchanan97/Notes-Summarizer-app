When we say Chandra is a female bank teller, and earns , a year, or Austin is a male bank teller, and earns , a year, we have in our information repository some individual facts. They can be looked up and consulted when necessary, as you ll learn in the first part of this book. But if we say women make less money than men do, even at the same jobs, we re in a different realm entirely. We have now generalized from specific facts to more wide-reaching tendencies. In the language of our discipline, we ve moved from information to knowledge. Properly gleaning knowledge from information is a trickier business than interpreting individual data points. There are established rules, some of them mathematical, for determining when an apparent pattern is actually reliable, what kinds of relationships can be detected with data, whether a relationship is causal, and so forth. We ll build some important foundations with this kind of reasoning in this Crystal Ballvolume and its follow-on companion. For now, I only want to make the point thatknowledge as opposed to mere information opens up a whole new world of understanding. No longer is the world limited to a chaotic collection of individual observations: we can now begin to understand the general ways in which the world works and perhaps even to change them. CHAPTER .
