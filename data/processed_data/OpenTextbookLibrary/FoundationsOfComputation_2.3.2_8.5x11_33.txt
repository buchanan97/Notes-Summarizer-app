tput.) The key to understanding why this is true is to note that each w ire in the circuit notjustthe naloutputwire representsthevalueof someproposition. Furthermore, once you know which proposition is represente d by each input wire to a gate, it s obvious what proposition is represented by the output: You just combine the input propositions with the appropriate , , or operator, depending on what type of gate it is. To nd the proposition as sociated with the naloutput, youjusthavetostartfromtheinputsandmoveth roughthecircuit, labeling the output wire of each gate with the proposition th at it represents. Figure1.6illustrates this process. . APPLICATION: LOGIC CIRCUITS (A B)BA (A B)(A B) (A B)(A B) (A B)A B(A B) (A B) . We know that the final output of the circuit is computed by an AND gate, whose inputs are as shown. . These inputs, in turn come from an OR gate and a NOT gate, with inputs as shown. . The circuit is completed by adding an AND gate to compute the input for the NOT gate, and and connecting the circuit inputs, A and B, to the apropriate gate inputs. Figure : Stages in the construction of a circuit that comp utes the compound proposition (A B) (A B). So, compound propositions correspond naturally with combi natorial logic circuits. But we have still not quite settled the question of just how powerful these circuits and propositions are. We ve looked at a nu mber of logical operators and noted that they can all be expressed in terms of , , and . But might there be other operators that cannot be so expresse d? Equivalently, might there be other types of logic gates
