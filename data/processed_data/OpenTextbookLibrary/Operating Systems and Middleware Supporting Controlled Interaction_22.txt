as one example of middleware. Such systems provide a more sophisticated form of persistent storage than the les supported by most operating systems. I use Oracle as my primary source of examples regarding relational database systems. Other middleware I will use for examples in the book includes the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2 EE) and IBM's Web Sphere MQ. These systems provide support for keeping computations largely isolated from undesirable interactions, while allowing them to communicate with one another even if running on di erent computers. The marketing de nition of middleware doesn't always correspond exactly with my technical de nition. In particular, some middleware is of such fundamental importance that it is distributed as part of the operating system bundle, rather than as a separate middleware product. As an example, general-purpose operating systems all come equipped with some mechanism for translating Internet hostnames, such as www.gustavus.edu , into numerical addresses. These mechanisms are typically outside the operating system kernel, but provide a general supporting service to application programs. Therefore, by my de nition, they are middleware, even if not normally labeled as such. Application Application Middleware Operating System Application Middleware Operating System Database Table Figure : Middleware uses services from an operating system and in turn provides services to application programs to support controlled interaction. CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION Objectives for the Book If you work your way through this book, you will gain both knowledge and skills. Notice that I did not say anything about reading the book, but rather about working your way through the book. Each chapter in this book concludes with exercises, programming projects, exploration projects, and some bibliographic or historical notes. To achieve the objectives
