field of programming is young and still developing rapidly, and it is varied enough to have room for wildly different approaches. There are many terrible mistakes to make in program design, and you should go ahead and make them at least once so that you understand them. A sense of what a good program looks like is developed with practice, not learned from a list of rules. Whylanguagematters In the beginning, at the birth of computing, there were no programming languages. Programs looked something like this: 00110001 00000000 00000000 00110001 00000001 00000001 00110011 00000001 00000010 01010001 00001011 00000010 00100010 00000010 00001000 01000011 00000001 00000000 01000001 00000001 00000001 00010000 00000010 00000000 01100010 00000000 00000000 This is a program to add the numbers from to together and print the result: . It could run on a simple hypothetical machine. To program early computers, it was necessary to set large arrays of switches in the right position or punch holes in strips of cardboard and feed them to the computer. You can imagine how tedious and error prone this procedure was. Even writing simple programs required much cleverness and discipline. Complex ones were nearly inconceivable. Of course, manually entering these arcane patterns of bits (the ones and zeros) did give the programmer a profound sense of being a mighty wizard. And that has to be worth something in terms of job satisfaction. Each line of the previous program contains a single instruction. It could be written in English like this: .Store the number in memory location . .Store the number in memory location . .Store the value of memory location in memory location . .Subtract the number from the value in memory location
