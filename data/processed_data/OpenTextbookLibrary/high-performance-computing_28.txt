location 1000. Virtual-to-physical address mapping The operating system stores the page-table addresses virtually , so it s going to take a virtual-to-physical translation to locate the table in memory . One more virtual-to- physical translation, and we finally have the true address of location 1000. The memory reference can complete, and the processor can return to executing your program. Translation Lookaside Buffer As you can see, address translation through a page table is pretty complicated. It required two table lookups (maybe three) to locate our data. If every memory reference was that complicated, virtual memory computers would be horrible performers. Fortunately , locality of reference causes virtual address translations to group together; a program may repeat the same virtual page mapping millions of times a second. And where we have repeated use of the same data, we can apply a cache. All modern virtual memory machines have a special cache called a translation lookaside buffer (TLB) for virtual-to-physical-memory-address translation. The two inputs to the TLB are an integer that identifies the program making the memory request and the virtual page requested. From the output pops a pointer to the physical page number . Virtual address in; physical address out. TLB lookups occur in parallel with instruction execution, so if the address data is in the TLB, memory references proceed quickly . Like other kinds of caches, the TLB is limited in size. It doesn t contain enough entries to handle all the possible virtual-to-physical-address translations for all the programs that might run on your computer . Larger pools of address translations are kept out in memory , in the page tables. If your program asks for a virtual-to- physical-address translation,
