above example allows us to co nclude that p (p q) is logically equivalent to p q. This means that if you were to make a truth table for these two expressions, the truth value s in the column for p (p q) would be identical to those in the column for p q. We know this without actually making the table. In this case, the table wo uld only be four lines long and easy enough to make. But Boolean algebra can be applied in cases where the number of propositional variables is too lar ge for a truth table to be practical. Let sdoanotherexample. Recallthatacompoundpropositio nisatautology if it is true for all possible combinations of truth values of the propositional variables that it contains. But another way of saying the sam e thing is that P is a tautology if P T. So, we can prove that a compound proposition, P, is a tautology by nding a chain of logical equivalences leadin g from Pto T. For . BOOLEAN ALGEBRA example: ((p q) p) q ( ((p q) p)) qde nition of ( (p q) ( p)) q De Morgan s Law, Theorem ( (p q) p) q Double Negation, Theorem ( (p q)) (p q) Associative Law for T Law of Excluded Middle From this chain of equivalences, we can conclude that (( p q) p) qis a tautology. Now, it takes some practice to look at an expression and see wh ich rules can be applied to it; to see ( (p q)) (p q) as an application of the law of the excluded middle for example, you need to mentally substitut e (p q) forpin
