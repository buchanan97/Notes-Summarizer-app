ky , but ev erything else is straigh tforw ard. First I need to enco de the color mixes from b efore and after 1995: mix94 dict(brown , yellow , red , green , orange , tan ) mix96 dict(blue , green , orange , yellow , red , brown ) Then I ha v e to enco de the h yp otheses: hypo A dict(bag1 mix94, bag2 mix96) hypo B dict(bag1 mix96, bag2 mix94) hypo A represen ts the h yp othesis that Bag is from 1994 and Bag from 1996. hypo B is the other w a y around. Next I map from the name of the h yp othesis to the represen tation: hypotheses dict(A hypo A, B hypo B) And nally I can write Likelihood . In this case the h yp othesis, hypo , is a string, either A or B . The data is a tuple that sp eci es a bag and a color. def Likelihood(self, data, hypo): bag, color data mix self.hypotheses hypo bag like mix color return like Here's the co de that creates the suite and up dates it: suite M and M( ' AB ' ) suite.Update(( ' bag1 ' , ' yellow ' )) suite.Update(( ' bag2 ' , ' green ' )) suite.Print() Chapter .
