in the OSI Model. The OSI model stands for Open Systems Interconnection, and was created by the International Organization for Standardization, an international nongovernmental group of professionals who strive to establish standards and best practices in a variety of fields. The OSI Model for networking breaks the system of transmitting data into the layers show below in an attempt to delineate where certain actions should take place.

In the diagram, transmission of data crosses two routers and over the Internet to reach its destination. By following the data along the arrows, we see it pass through various layers of communication and processing as it crosses the internal network, through the first router, across the public network (internet connection), into the recipient s router, and then is reassembled into its original form. Until recently, most network equipment has operated on IPv4, the fourth standard re - leased for IP addresses, which has been in place for about thirty years. Addresses in this format are typically represented as a pattern of four blocks of up to three digits separated by periods, with no block of numbers exceeding such as or . This is referred to as dot-decimal representation, and although it is not the only way to express an IPv4 address it is the most recognized form. Segments of the addresses within the ranges of .xxx.xxx, .xxx.xxx to .xxx.xxx, and .xxx.xxx to .xxx.xxx are reserved for private networks, meaning
