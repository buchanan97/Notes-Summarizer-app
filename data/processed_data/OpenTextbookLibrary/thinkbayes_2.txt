y p oin t in the game. That is not exactly true, but it is probably a go o d enough mo del for most purp oses. In Chapter the motiv ating problem is in terpreting SA T scores (the SA T is a standardized test used for college admissions in the United States). I start with a simple mo del that assumes that all SA T questions are equally di cult, but in fact the designers of the SA T delib erately include some questions that are relativ ely easy and some that are relativ ely hard. I presen t a second mo del that accoun ts for this asp ect of the design, and sho w that it do esn't ha v e a big e ect on the results after all. I think it is imp ortan t to include mo deling as an explicit part of problem solving b ecause it reminds us to think ab out mo deling errors (that is, errors due to simpli cations and assumptions of the mo del). Man y of the metho ds in this b o ok are based on discrete distributions, whic h mak es some p eople w orry ab out n umerical errors. But for real-w orld problems, n umerical errors are almost alw a ys smaller than mo deling errors. F urthermore, the discrete approac h often allo ws b etter mo deling decisions, and I w ould rather ha v e an appro ximate solution to a go o d mo del than an exact solution to a bad mo del. On the other hand, con tin uous metho ds sometimes yield p erformance
