m. How do the results of this experiment compare to the results using the rst type of ER graph? Chapter Small World Graphs Many networks in the real world, including social networks, have the small world property", which is that the average distance between nodes, measured in number of edges on the shortest path, is much smaller than expected. In this chapter, I present Stanley Milgram's famous Small World Experiment, which was the rst demonstration of the small world property in a real social network. Then we'll consider Watts-Strogatz graphs, which are intended as a model of small world graphs. I'll replicate the experiment Watts and Strogatz performed and explain what it is intended to show. Along the way, we'll see two new graph algorithms: breadth- rst search (BFS) and Dijkstra's algorithm for computing the shortest path between nodes in a graph. The code for this chapter is in chap03.ipynb in the repository for this book. More information about working with the code is in Section . Stanley Milgram Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who conducted two of the most famous experiments in social science, the Milgram experiment, which studied people's obedience to authority ( http: thinkcomplex.com Chapter Small World Graphs milgram ) and the Small World Experiment, which studied the structure of social networks ( http: thinkcomplex.com small ). In the Small World Experiment, Milgram sent a package to several randomlychosen people in Wichita, Kansas, with instructions asking them to forward an enclosed letter to a target person, identi ed by name and occupation, in Sharon, Massachusetts (which happens to be the town near Boston where I grew up). The subjects were told that they could mail
