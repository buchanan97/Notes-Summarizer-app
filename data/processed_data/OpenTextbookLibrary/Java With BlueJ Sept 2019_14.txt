number of digits, or, we write it as , to indic ate the number has an infinite representation. A similar case arises with computers - there are fractions that cannot be represented exactly in a computer. With limited space we are often storing just an approximation. One must be aware that round -off can occur when calculations are done with float and double. Hence they are not appropriate for certain situations: for example if your program needs to represent monetary values. A highly recommended book on Java is Effective Java . This is a great referenc e for the experienced programmer for monetary calculations the Big Decimal class is recommended. The following program demonstrates a calculation: one value subtracted from another. If you performed the calculation yourself, you would say the answer is . However this program prints a different answer. We have included this example to illustrate how some values are just approximate values. Listing : Approximations.java public class Approximations public static void main(String args) the following result should be but the value printed is System.out.println( - ); The output from the above is: Default Decimal Data Type When a num eric literal (such as ) appears in a program with a decimal point, the data type used is double ; we say double is the default data type for values with a decimal point. If the programmer wanted to use a float value then the suffix f would be used, as in .25f . To a non -programmer literals such as and may seem the same, but a Java programmer knows the first is represented internally as a double and the second is represented as an int. We
