the probability that the graph is connected is very low when pis small and nearly when pis large. Between these two regimes, there is a rapid transition at a particular value of p, denotedp . Erd os and R enyi showed that this critical value is p (lnn) n, wherenis the number of nodes. A random graph, G(n;p), is unlikely to be connected if p p and very likely to be connected if p p . To test this claim, we'll develop algorithms to generate random graphs and check whether they are connected. Generating graphs Figure : A complete graph with nodes. Generating graphs I'll start by generating a complete graph, which is a graph where every node is connected to every other. Here's a generator function that takes a list of nodes and enumerates all distinct pairs. If you are not familiar with generator functions, you can read about them at http: thinkcomplex.com gen . def all pairs(nodes): for i, u in enumerate(nodes): for j, v in enumerate(nodes): if i j: yield u, v We can use all pairs to construct a complete graph: def make complete graph(n): G nx.Graph() nodes range(n) G.add nodes from(nodes) G.add edges from(all pairs(nodes)) return G make complete graph takes the number of nodes, n, and returns a new Graph with nnodes and edges between all pairs of nodes. Chapter Graphs The following code makes a complete graph with nodes and draws it: complete make complete graph( ) nx.draw circular(complete, node color COLORS , node size 1000, with labels True) Figure shows the result. Soon we will modify this code to generate ER graphs, but rst we'll develop functions to check whether a graph
