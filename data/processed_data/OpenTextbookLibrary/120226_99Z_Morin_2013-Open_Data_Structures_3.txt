Acknowledgments I am grateful to Nima Hoda, who spent a summer tirelessly proofreading many of the chapters in this book; to the students in the Fall 2011 o ering of COMP2402 2002, who put up with the rst draft of this book and spotted many typographic, grammatical, and factual errors; and to Morgan Tunzelmann at Athabasca University Press, for patiently editing several near- nal drafts. xi Why This Book? There are plenty of books that teach introductory data structures. Some of them are very good. Most of them cost money, and the vast majority of computer science undergraduate students will shell out at least some cash on a data structures book. Several free data structures books are available online. Some are very good, but most of them are getting old. The majority of these books became free when their authors and or publishers decided to stop updating them. Updating these books is usually not possible, for two reasons: ( ) The copyright belongs to the author and or publisher, either of whom may not allow it. ( ) The source code for these books is often not available. That is, the Word, Word Perfect, Frame Maker, or L ATEX source for the book is not available, and even the version of the software that handles this source may not be available. The goal of this project is to free undergraduate computer science students from having to pay for an introductory data structures book. I have decided to implement this goal by treating this book like an Open Source software project. The L ATEX source, Java source, and build scripts for the book are available to download from the author s
