move our consideration to the silver medal. Since one of the athletes has already been awarded the gold medal, only nine of them remain in contention for the silver medal, so for any choice of athlete who wins gold, the number of choices for who gets the silver medal is nine. Finally, with the gold and silver medalists out of contention for the bronze, there remain eight choices for who might win that medal. Thus, the total number of ways in which the medals might be awarded is10 . We can use the same reasoning to determine a general formula for the number of rpermutations of nobjects: THEOREM . The number of r-permutations of nobjects isn(n ) (n r ) . PROOF. There arenways in which the first object can be chosen (any of the nobjects). For each of these possible choices, there remain n 1objects to choose for the second object, etc. It will be very handy to have a short form for the number of permutations of nobjects. NOT A TION . We usen!to denote the number of permutations of nobjects, so n! n(n ) . By convention, we define ! . DEFINITION . We readn!as n factorial , sonfactorial is n(n ) . Thus, the number of r-permutations of nobjects can be re-written as n! (n r)!. When n rthis givesn! ! n!, making sense of our definition that ! . EXAMPLE . In1150 CE, the Indian mathematician Bh skara II (1114 1185) wrote a four-part book about mathematics and astronomy, entitled Siddh nta Siromani ( Crown of treatises ). One of the pr
