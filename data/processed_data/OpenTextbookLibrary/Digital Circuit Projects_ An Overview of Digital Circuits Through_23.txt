this book as a lab manual. I would suggest that this chapter be skipped by hobbyists using this textbook for bread boarding projects. A Universal Set of Boolean Operations When thinking about Boolean algebra , it is important to realize that Boolean values are binary, so any Boolean variable is limited to two values. Often these values will be True or False , but in reality any binary values can be used. In this textbook, the value will be used for False, and for True . The reason for using and is that it is a more natural and useful way to represent these values in an engineering context, which will hopefully become apparent to the reader as they continue thei r study of computer organization. To be useful some minimum set of operations which can be used to manipulate those Boolean variables. For Boolean algebra this minimum set of operations will include just operations, they are AND, OR, and NOT. The AND and OR operations are binary operations (operations that take two operands), and the NOT is a unary operation (operation that takes one operand). These operations will be defined formally using truth tables in the next section. For now they will be defined informally as follows: the AND operator is f(A,B), where f(A,B) is (true) where A, B are both (true) otherwise it is (false). the OR operator is f(A,B), where f(A,B) is (true) is A or B or both A and B are (true), otherwise it is (false). the NOT operator is f(A), where f(A) is (true) if A is (false), and f(A) is (false) if a is (true). This leads to a question as to w
