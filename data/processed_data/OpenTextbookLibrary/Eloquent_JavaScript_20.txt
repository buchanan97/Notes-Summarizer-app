at that position. This example produces the string "half of is " . Unaryoperators Not all operators are symbols. Some are written as words. One example is the typeofoperator, which produces a string value naming the type of the value you give it. console.log(typeof ) number console.log(typeof "x") string We will use console.log in example code to indicate that we want to see the result of evaluating something. (More about that in the next chapter .) The other operators shown so far in this chapter all operated on two values, but typeoftakes only one. Operators that use two values are called binary operators, while those that take one are called unaryoperators. The minus operator ( -) can be used both as a binary operator and as a unary operator. console.log(- ( - )) - Booleanvalues It is often useful to have a value that distinguishes between only two possibilities, like yes and no or on and off . For this purpose, Java Script has a Booleantype, which has just two values, true and false, written as those words. Comparison Here is one way to produce Boolean values: console.log( ) true console.log( ) false The and signs are the traditional symbols for is greater than and is less than , respectively. They are binary operators. Applying them results in a Boolean value that indicates whether they hold true in this case. Strings can be compared in the same way. console.log("Aardvark" "Zoroaster") true The way strings are ordered is roughly alphabetic but not really what you d expect to see in a dictionary: uppercase letters are always less than lowercase ones, so "Z" "a" , and nonalphabetic characters (!, -, and so
