VALIDATION AND TEXT MANIPULATION Example . Validating the format of a SIN Suppose we want to verify that a social insurance number is properly composed as digits, a dash, digits, a dash, digits. For example, " - - " is a properly formatted SIN. The following program splits the SIN into parts based on a dash ( "-"), and then checks to see that each part consists of digits. Listing : splitting text on a dash and validating elements are numeric 1public class Validate Format public static void main ( String args ) String sin " - - "; if ( validate SIN ( sin)) System . out. println (sin " is correctly formed "); else System . out. println (sin " is not correctly formed "); public static boolean validate SIN ( String sin ) ensure a value was passed in boolean valid !( sin null ); if ( valid ) String sin Parts ; sin Parts sin. split ("-"); must have parts valid sin. length () ; valid sin Parts . length ; if ( valid ) remove the dashes String temp sin. replace ("-",""); for ( char c: temp . to Char Array ()) valid Character .
