and Practice, Release User A User B Service provider ("the network")Service Access Point Primitives Figure : Users and service provider Throughout this book, we will de ne a service as a set of capabilities provided by a system (and its underlying elements) to its user. A user interacts with a service through a service access point. Note that as shown in the gure above, users interact with one service provider. In practice, the service provider is distributed over several hosts, but these are implementation details that are not important at this stage. These interactions between a user and a service provider are expressed in X200 by using primitives, as show in the gure below. These primitives are an abstract representation of the interactions between a user and a service provider. In practice, these interactions could be implemented as system calls for example. User A User B Service provider ("the network")X.indication X.response X.confirm X.request Figure : The four types of primitives Four types of primitives are de ned : X.request. This type of primitive corresponds to a request issued by a user to a service provider X.indication. This type of primitive is generated by the network provider and delivered to a user (often related to an earlier and remote X.request primitive) X.response. This type of primitive is generated by a user to answer to an earlier X.indication primitive X.con rm. This type of primitive is delivered by the service provide to con rm to a user that a previous X.request primitive has been successfully processed. Primitives can be combined to model different types of services. The simplest service in computer networks is called the connectionless service3. This service can be modelled
