The don t cares (Xs) in the map are important because we can assume they are when they help us minimize an expression, and assume they are otherwise. In short, we can use them to create larger groupings, but they do not have to be used. The K -map for segment A is the following: The result is two groups of (in red and purple ) corresponding to A and B , and two groups of , one (in black) corresponding to BD , and one (in yellow , crossing the corners of the map) cor responding to B'C', resulting in the following equation for segment A, f A(A,B,C,D) A C BD B'D' Conclusion Boolean algebra, or functions where the values are binary or two digit values, is the basis for the circuits that will be presented in this text. Boolean functions can always be represented in a truth table, and then translated directly into DNF. Thus any Boolean function can be written using only AND, OR, and NOT operations. To instantiate these functions into hardware for a computer, circuits will be used. For a number of reasons, including making the circuit faster and decreasing the amount of electricity used and the amount of heat generated, it is of interest to designers
