such repetition. Large programs are so complex that it would be almost impossi ble to write them if there were not some way to break them up into manageable chunks. S ubroutines provide one way to do this. A subroutine consists of the instructions for performing some task, grou ped together as a unit and given a name. That name can then be used as a substi tute for the whole set of instructions. For example, suppose that one of the tasks tha t your program needs to perform is to draw a house on the screen. You can take the necessary ins tructions, make them into a subroutine, and give that subroutine some appropriate nam e say, draw House() . Then anyplace in your program where you need to draw a house, you ca n do so with the single command: draw House(); This will have the same e ect as repeating all the house-draw ing instructions in each place. The advantage here is not just that you save typing. Organizi ng your program into subroutinesalsohelpsyouorganizeyourthinkingandyourp rogramdesigne ort. Whilewriting the house-drawing subroutine, you can concentrate on the pr oblem of drawing a house without worrying for the moment about the rest of the program. And onc e the subroutine is written, you can forget about the details of drawing houses that prob lem is solved, since you have a CHAPTER . THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE subroutine to do it for you. A subroutine becomes just like a b uilt-in part of the language which you can use without thinking about the details of what goes on inside the subroutine. Variables, types, loops, branches, and subroutines are the basis of what
