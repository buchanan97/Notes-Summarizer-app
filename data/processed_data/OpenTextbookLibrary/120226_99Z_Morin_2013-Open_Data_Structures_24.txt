In this case, the worst-case monthly cost of paying this mortgage is per month. If we have enough cash on hand, we might choose to buy the house outright, with one payment of . In this case, over a period of years, the amortized monthly cost of buying this house is 120000 months 1000 per month : This is much less than the per month we would have to pay if we took out a mortgage.

In the unlikely event that the entire house burns down, the actual cost will be . These nancial examples also o er insight into why
