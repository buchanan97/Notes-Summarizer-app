of , we see that in the only case where pis true and p qis true,qis also true. So from the truth of If the party is on Tuesday, then I will be at the party and The party is in fac t on Tuesday, you can deduce that I will be at the party is also true. But su ppose, on the other hand, that the party is actually on Wednesday. Then pis false. When pis false and p qis true, the de nition of p qallowsqto be either true or false. So, in this case, you can t make any deduction about whether or not I will be at the party. The statement If the party is on Tuesda y, then I ll be there doesn t assert anything about what will happen if the party is on some other day than Tuesday. The implication ( q) ( p) is called the contrapositive ofp q. An implication is logically equivalent to its contrapositive . The contrapositive of If this is Tuesday, then we are in Belgium is If we aren t in Belgium, then this isn t Tuesday. These two sentences assert exactly the same thing. Note that p qisnotlogically equivalent to q p. The implication q p is called the converse ofp q. The converse of If this is Tuesday, then we are in Belgium is If we are in Belgium, then this is Tuesday. Note that it is possible for either one of these statements to be true whil e the other is false. In English, I might express the fact that both statements are true by saying If this is Tuesday, then we are in
