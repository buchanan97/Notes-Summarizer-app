button that says Clone or download". I developed this book using Anaconda from Continuum Analytics, which is a free Python distribution that includes all the packages you'll need to run the code (and lots more). I found Anaconda easy to install. By default it does a user-level installation, not system-level, so you don't need administrative privileges. And it supports both Python and Python . You can download Anaconda from https: continuum.io downloads . The repository includes both Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks. If you have not used Jupyter before, you can read about it at https: jupyter.org . There are three ways you can work with the Jupyter notebooks: Run Jupyter on your computer If you installed Anaconda, you can install Jupyter by running the following command in a terminal or Command Window: conda install jupyter Using the code xv Before you launch Jupyter, you should cdinto the directory that contains the code: cd Think Complexity2 code And then start the Jupyter server: jupyter notebook When you start the server, it should launch your default web browser or create a new tab in an open browser window. Then you can open and run the notebooks. Run Jupyter on Binder Binder is a service that runs Jupyter in a virtual machine. If you follow this link, http: thinkcomplex.com binder , you should get a Jupyter home page with the notebooks for this book and the supporting data and scripts. You can run the scripts and modify them to run your own code, but the virtual machine you run them in is temporary. If you leave it idle, the virtual machine disappears along with any changes you made. View notebooks on Git
