input values A and B are binary, as is the output value f(A,B). It is possible to completely characterize the function f(A,B) by enumerating all the possible input combinations and A and B ( , , , ), and specifying the output f(A,B) for each input combination. A truth table is standard way to represent a Boolean function which enumerates all the possible outputs of that function. So assume f(A,B) is the AND operator. The truth table for this operation is: Input Output A B AND Table - : AND truth table More than one function can be represented in a truth table. A truth table that represents two functions, AND and OR, would be the following: Input Output A B AND OR Table - : AND and OR truth table All Boolean functions can be represented using truth tables (the proof for this is left for the exercises at the end of this section), though the size could become quite large, or possibly infinite. F or example, consider two Boolean functions f1(A,B,C) and f2(A,B,C). The truth table for these two functions would be written as follows: DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS Input Output A B C f1(A,B,C) f2(A,B,C) Table - : Truth table for f1(A,B,C) and f2(A,B,C) Disjunctive Normal Form(DNF) Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF ) is a standard way to write Boolean functions. It can be described as a sum or products , and an OR and ANDS3. To understand DNF, first the concept of a minterm will be covered. A minterm is a row in the truth table where the output function for that term is true. For example, in Table - , the function f1(A,B,C) has a minterm
