is not even idiomatic, unless the object of the transitive verb can be taken as understood.) Observation is always selective. It needs a chosen object, a definite task, an interest, a point of view, a problem. And its description presupposes a descriptive language, with property words; it presupposes similarity and classification, which in their turn presuppose interests, points of view, and problems (Popper 1963). So, the data used in ML is always incomplete. It is becoming increasingly common in ML circles to use the phrases 'ground truth' or 'ground truths' or 'ground truth data set'. Caution is needed here. No matter how much care goes into gathering and curating the data, it can still be wrong and incomplete. There are many other pitfalls that can occur sample data or training data even if the data is absolutely correct. The data may be 'unbalanced'. An example that can be used here is that of a test predicting the (unknown) gender of a person from their (known) height. If the training data, the sample, where the heights and genders are known, consists of males and females, then mathematics will suggest predicting male no matter what the height of the test subject is. In sum, getting good training data is tricky. Types of Machine Learning Supervised Supervised learning is learning with a teacher a teacher who knows the answers. An example will help here: Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR is a solution a supervised classification problem . It can look at some text e.g. Call me Ishmael and identify, or recognize, that the first letter of the text is a C , the second letter is an a , and so on. ML
