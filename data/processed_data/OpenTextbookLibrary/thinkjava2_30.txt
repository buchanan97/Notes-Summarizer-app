byte code and something goes wrong. These errorsarealsocalled exceptions becausetheyusuallyindicatethatsomething unexpected has happened. Run-time errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one. When a run-time error occurs, the program crashes (terminates) and displays an error message that explains what happened and where. For example, if you accidentally divide by zero, you will get a message like this: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Arithmetic Exception: by zero at Hello.main(Hello.java: ) Vocabulary Error messages are very useful for debugging. The first line includes the name of the exception,Arithmetic Exception, and a message that indicates more specifically what happened, division by zero. The next line shows the method where the error occurred;Hello.mainindicates the methodmainin the class Hello. It also reports the file where the method is defined,Hello.java, and the line number where the error occurred, . The third type of error is alogic error. If your program has a logic error, it will compile and run without generating error messages, but it will not do the right thing. Instead, it will do exactly what you told it to do. For example, here is a version of the Hello World program with a logic error: public class Hello public static void main(String args) System.out.println("Hello, "); System.out.println("World!"); This program compiles and runs just fine, but the output is as follows: Hello, World! Assuming that we wanted the output on one line, this is not correct. The problem is that the first line usesprintln, when we probably meant to use print(see the Goodbye, cruel world example of Section ). Identifying logic errors can be hard because you have to work
