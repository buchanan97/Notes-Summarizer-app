of the different primitives, but the distance between two primitives does not represent a precise amount of time. The gure below provides a representation of the connectionless service as a time-sequence diagram. The user on the left, having address S, issues a Data.request primitive containing SDU Mthat must be delivered by the service provider to destination D. The dashed line between the two primitives indicates that the Data.indication primitive that is delivered to the user on the right corresponds to the Data.request primitive sent by the user on the left. Source Provider Destination DATA.request(S, D, "M") DATA.indication(S, D, "M") Time Figure : A simple connectionless service There are several possible implementations of the connectionless service, which we will discuss later in this book. Before studying these realisations, it is useful to discuss the possible characteristics of the connectionless service. Areliable connectionless service is a service where the service provider guarantees that all SDUs submitted in Data.requests by a user will eventually be delivered to their destination. Such a service would be very useful for users, but guaranteeing perfect delivery is dif cult in practice. For this reason, computer networks usually support anunreliable connectionless service. Anunreliable connectionless service may suffer from various types of problems compared to a reliable connectionless service. First of all, an unreliable connectionless service does not guarantee the delivery of all SDUs. This can be expressed graphically by using the time-sequence diagram below. In practice, an unreliable connectionless service will usually deliver a large fraction of the SDUs. However, since the delivery of SDUs is not guaranteed, the user must be able to recover from the loss of any SDU. A second imperfection that may affect an
