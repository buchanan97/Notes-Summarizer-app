the server of their status ( e.g., Requesting interactions, or being Invisible). In the remainder of this chapter we will focus on TCP Sockets. First, we show how to create a client socket, connect it to a server, exchange data and close the connection (Section ). This lifecycle is illustrated using examples Local Area Networks. TCP Client showing the use of client sockets to interact with a web server. Next, Section presents server sockets. We describe their life-cycle and how to use them to implement a server that can handle concurrent connections. Last, we introduce socket streams in Section . We give an overview of their bene ts by describing their use on both client and server side. TCP Client We call TCP client an application that initiates a TCP connection to exchange data with another application: the server . It is important to mention that the client and the server may be developed in different languages. The life-cycle of such a client in Pharo decomposes into steps: . Create a TCP socket. . Connect the socket to a server. . Exchange data with the server through the socket. . Close the socket. Create a TCP Socket Pharo provides a single socket class. It has one creation method per socket type (TCP or UDP). To create a TCP socket, you need to evaluate the following expression: Socket new TCP Connect a TCP Socket to some Server To connect a TCP Socket to a server, you need to have the object representing the IP address of that server. This address is an instance of Socket Address . A handy way to create it is to use Net Name Resolver that provides
