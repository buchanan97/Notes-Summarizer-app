Recommended general computer science books xxviii Contents Chapter The way of the program The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (speci cally computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeo s among alternativ es. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypothes es, and test predictions. The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving . Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems,
