in later chapters is often written for a specific environment (the browser or Node.js) and can run only there. In addition, many chapters define bigger programs, and the pieces of code that appear in them depend on each other or on external files. The sandbox on the website provides links to ZIP files containing all the scripts and data files necessary to run the code for a given chapter. Overviewofthisbook This book contains roughly three parts. The first chapters discuss the Java Script language. The next seven chapters are about web browsers and the way Java Script is used to program them. Finally, two chapters are devoted to Node.js, another environment to program Java Script in. There are five project chapters in the book that describe larger example programs to give you a taste of actual programming. The language part of the book starts with four chapters that introduce the basic structure of the Java Script language. They discuss control structures (such as the whileword you saw in this introduction), functions (writing your own building blocks), and data structures . After these, you will be able to write basic programs. Next, Chapters 5and6introduce techniques to use functions and objects to write more abstract code and keep complexity under control. After afirst project chapter that builds a crude delivery robot, the language part of the book continues with chapters on error handling and bug fixing , regular expressions (an important tool for working with text), modularity (another defense against complexity), and asynchronous programming (dealing with events that take time). The second project chapter , where we implement a programming language, concludes the first part of the book. The second part of
