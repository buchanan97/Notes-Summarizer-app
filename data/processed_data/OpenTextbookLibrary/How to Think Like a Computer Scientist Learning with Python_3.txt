and Lisp. In reading Je rey s preface, I am struck by his comments that Python allowed him to see a higher level of success and a lower level of frustration and that he was able to move faster with better results. Although these comments refer to his introductory course, I sometimes use Python for these exact same reasons in advanced graduate level computer science courses at the University of Chicago. In these courses, I am constantly faced with the daunting task of covering a lot o f di cult course material in a blistering nine week quarter. Although it is certainly possible for me to in ict a lot of pain and su ering by using a language like C , I have often found this approach to be counterproductive especially when the course is about a topic unrelated to just programming. I nd that using Python allows me to better focus on the actual topic at hand while allowing students to complete substantial class projects. Although Python is still a young and evolving language, I believe that it has a bright future in education. This book is an important step in that direction. David Beazley University of Chicago Author of the Python Essential Reference Preface By Je Elkner This book owes its existence to the collaboration made possible by the Int ernet and the free software movement. Its three authors a college professor, a high school teacher, and a professional programmer have yet to meet face to face, but we have been able to work closely together and have been aided by many wonderful folks who have donated their time and energy to helping make this book better.
