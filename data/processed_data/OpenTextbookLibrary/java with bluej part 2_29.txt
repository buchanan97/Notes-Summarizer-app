Note the exception includes the informative message and the line number where the exception was thrown. CHAPTER . VALIDATION AND TEXT MANIPULATION Figure : Illegal argument detected at run time. . MANIPULATING TEXT Manipulating Text In Part of this text several methods of the String and Character classes were presented and used. Here we introduce two more methods of the String class which are quite useful in practical coding. Following this we discuss the String Builder class that provides capabilities similar to String. split and to Char Array to Char Array is used to convert a string into an array of char . For instance the code snippet below counts the number of numeric characters in a string s. count the number of digits in s char x s. to Char Array (); int count ; for ( char c: x) if ( Character . is Digit (c)) count ; The split method is used to split a string into an array of strings based on a splitting expression. For example the following code snippet creates strings based on "-"as a delimiter. split a string based on the delimiter "-" String course "ACS -2814 - "; String parts course . split ("-"); for ( String p: parts ) System .out. println (p); The output of the code snippet follows - the string "ACS-2814- " was split into strings, each stored as an element of the array parts : The argument provided to the split method is formally called a regular
