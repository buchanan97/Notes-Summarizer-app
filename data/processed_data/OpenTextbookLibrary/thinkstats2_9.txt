come out two weeks early!!" I don't think that can be true because my sister was my mother's rst and she was early, as with many of my cousins." Reports like these are called anecdotal evidence because they are based on data that is unpublished and usually personal. In casual conversation, Chapter . Exploratory data analysis there is nothing wrong with anecdotes, so I don't mean to pick on the people I quoted. But we might want evidence that is more persuasive and an answer that is more reliable. By those standards, anecdotal evidence usually fails, because: Small number of observations: If pregnancy length is longer for rst babies, the di erence is probably small compared to natural variation. In that case, we might have to compare a large number of pregnancies to be sure that a di erence exists. Selection bias: People who join a discussion of this question might be interested because their rst babies were late. In that case the process of selecting data would bias the results. Con rmation bias: People who believe the claim might be more likely to contribute examples that con rm it. People who doubt the claim are more likely to cite counterexamples. Inaccuracy: Anecdotes are often personal stories, and often misremembered, misrepresented, repeated inaccurately, etc. So how can we do better? A statistical approach To address the limitations of anecdotes, we will use the tools of statistics, which include: Data collection: We will use data from a large national survey that was designed explicitly with the goal of generating statistically valid inferences about the U.S. population. Descriptive statistics: We will generate statistics that summarize the data concisely, and evaluate di erent
