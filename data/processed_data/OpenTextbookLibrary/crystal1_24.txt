scratch. Instead, draw a memory picture, update it accordingly as you walk through each line of code, and then look at it for the answer. Tip By the way, investing in a small whiteboard and a couple of markers is a great way to help you learn programming. They re perfect for drawing and updating memory pictures as they evolve. Hopefully this chapter was straightforward. These memory pictures willbegettingincreasinglycomplexaswelearnmorekindsofthings to store, however, so stay sharp! Chapter Calculations Our discipline obviously involves a lot of computation in fact, I expect the first image that comes to mind when most people hear the words data science is one of numerical calculation. In this chapter, I ll lay out the Python syntax for performing various mathematical operations on numbers, as well as manipulating strings. These things appear in every program, and you ll find it all straightforward. And then I ll drop a bomb on you. I ll unveil a Python behavior whichyou llprobablyfindcompletelyunexpected,whichflummoxes nearly every student who first sees it, and yet which you must understand and master to succeed in Python or any programming language. Mathematical operations First, the easy part. Python has a number of built-inoperators to do the familiar math stuff. Figure has a table of the ones we ll use. A few are mildly surprising ( instead of Xfor multiplication; instead of for division, which I ll bet you couldn t find on your keyboard anyway), and you have to remember to use only bananas (not boxies , curlies , or wakkas ) for grouping sub-expressions within a larger expression. Otherwise, it s a piece of cake. CHAPTER . CALCULATIONS Operator Operation addition -subtraction multiplication division exponentiation (
