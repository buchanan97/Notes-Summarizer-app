it will learn to play a better game of checkers than can be played by the person who wrote the program. Furthermore, it can learn to do this when given only the rules of the game, a sense of direction, and a redundant and incomplete list of parameters which are thought to have something to do with the game, but whose correct signs and relative weights are unknown and unspecified. The principles of Machine Learning verified by these experiments are, of course, applicable to many other situations. (Samuel 1959) Such programs learn by playing and by associating winning and losing with various strategies, moves, and tactics. A big advance came about fifty years after this, maybe around 2010, when the amount of data that it was possible to gather, record, and process, expanded massively (amounting to the so-called Big Data ). It should be emphasized here that it is not merely the amount of data that is important, but also it is the ability to process that data with a timely throughput (Amodei et al. 2019). Often this kind of learning has similarities to doing statistics with extremely large data sets. ML is distinctly different from other areas of AI, and the difference lies principally with the learning . For example, a while back, computer programs to diagnose a medical condition, say cancer, would mimic expert doctors and consultants, perhaps by attempting to extract rules governing sound or intelligent diagnoses and applying those rules. A programmer, or team of programmers, would write a program to diagnose cancer and the program would be finished and done. It is true that some tuning might be carried out after the fact, if the
