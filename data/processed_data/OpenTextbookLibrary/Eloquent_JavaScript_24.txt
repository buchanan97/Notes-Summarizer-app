is precisely equal to the other, and the second tests whether it is not precisely equal. Thus "" false is false, as expected. I recommend using the three-character comparison operators defensively to prevent unexpected type conversions from tripping you up. But when you re certain the types on both sides will be the same, there is no problem with using the shorter operators. Short-circuitingoflogicaloperators The logical operators and handle values of different types in a peculiar way. They will convert the value on their left side to Boolean type in order to decide what to do, but depending on the operator and the result of that conversion, they will return either the original left-hand value or the righthand value. The operator, for example, will return the value to its left when that value can be converted to true and will return the value on its right otherwise. This has the expected effect when the values are Boolean and does something analogous for values of other types. console.log(null "user") user console.log("Agnes" "user") Agnes We can use this functionality as a way to fall back on a default value. If you have a value that might be empty, you can put after it with a replacement value. If the initial value can be converted to false, you ll get the replacement instead. The rules for converting strings and numbers to Boolean values state that ,Na N, and the empty string ( "") count as false, while all the other values count as true. That means - produces - , and "" "!?" yields "!?". The ??operator resembles but returns the value on the right only if the one on the left is
