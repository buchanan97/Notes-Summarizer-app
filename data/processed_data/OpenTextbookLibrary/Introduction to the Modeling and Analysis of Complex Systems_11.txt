Collaboration with these wonderful people has given me lots of insight and energy to work on various complex systems research and education projects. I would also like to thank the people who gave me valuable feedback on the draft versions of this book, including Barry Goldman, Blake Stacey, Ernesto Costa, Ricardo Alvira, Joe Norman, Navdep Kaur, Dene Farrell, Aming Li, Daniel Goldstein, Stephanie Smith, Hoang Peter Ta, Nygos Fantastico, Michael Chambers, and Tarun Bist. Needless to say, I am solely responsible for all typos, errors, or mistakes remaining in this textbook. I would greatly appreciate any feedback from any of you. My nal thanks go to a non-living object, my Lenovo Y oga laptop, on which I was able to write the whole textbook anytime, anywhere. It endured the owner s careless handling (which caused its touchscreen to crack) and yet worked pretty well to the end. I hope you enjoy this Open
