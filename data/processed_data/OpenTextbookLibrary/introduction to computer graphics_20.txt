line segmen ts and triangles, are called geometric primitives . Di erent graphics systems make di erent sets of primitive s available, but in many cases only very basic shapes such as lines and tria ngles are considered primitive. A complex scene can contain a large number of primitives, and it would be very di cult to create the scene by giving explicit coordinates for each ind ividual primitive. The solution, as any programmer should immediately guess, is to chunk toge ther primitives into reusable components. For example, for a scene that contains several a utomobiles, we might create a geometric model of a wheel. An automobile can be modeled as fo ur wheels together with models of other components. And we could then use several cop ies of the automobile model in the scene. Note that once a geometric model has been designed , it can be used as a component in more complex models. This is referred to as hierarchical modeling . Suppose that we have constructed a model of a wheel out of geom etric primitives. When that wheel is moved into position in the model of an automobil e, the coordinates of all of its primitives will have to be adjusted. So what exactly have we g ained by building the wheel? The point is that all of the coordinates in the wheel are adjusted in the same way . That is, to place the wheel in the automobile, we just have to specify a single a djustment that is applied to the wheel as a whole. The type of adjustment that is used is call ed ageometric transform (or geometric transformation). A geometric transform is
