map when compared to a map with an RF of : , , (i.e., : , : , , ). Furthermore, while the large -scale map shows more detail and less area, the small -scale map shows more area but less detail. Clearly, determining the thresholds for small - or large - scale maps is largely a judgment call. All maps possess a scale, whether it is formally expre ssed or not. Though some say that online maps and GISs are scaleless because we can zoom in and out at will, it is probably more accurate to say that GISs and related mapping technology are multiscalar. Understanding map scale and its overall impact on h ow the earth and its features are represented is a critical part of both map making and GISs. Coordinate Systems Just as all maps have a map scale, all maps have locations, too. Coordinate systems are frameworks that are used to define unique positions. For instance, in geometry we use x (horizontal) and y (vertical) coordinates to define points on a two -dimensional plane. The coordinate system that is most commonly used to define locations on the three -dimensional earth is called the geographic coordinate system (GCS), and it is based on a sphere or spheroid. A spheroid (a.k.a. ellipsoid is simply a sphere that is slightly wider than it is tall and approximates more closely the true shape of the earth. Spheres are commonly used as mod els of the earth for simplicity. The unit of measure in the GCS is degrees, and locations are defined by their respective latitude and longitude within the GCS. Latitude is measured relative to the equator at zero
