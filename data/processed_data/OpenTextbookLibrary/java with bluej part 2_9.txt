Note the output below and how the Array List is displayed as a comma-separated-values list embedded in square brackets - this is the default display for an Array List . . ARRAY UTILITIES IN JAVA CLASS LIBRARIES Array utilities in Java class libraries Arrays are often used in programming and there are many important array algorithms. For instance, copying an array was discussed previously. The System class contains a method arraycopy() that can be used to copy a portion of one array to another. The method takes arguments (in this order): name of the source array, starting element position in the source, the destination array, the starting element position in the destination, and the total number of elements to copy. For instance to copy all elements of the array t to the array s we could use: System.arraycopy(t, , s, , t.length); There is a Java library class named java.util.Arrays that has additional methods which include: .equals() : Returns true if two arrays are equal to one another. The arrays are equal if they have the same number of elements and if corresponding elements are equal. .sort() : Rearranges the elements of an array so they are in ascending sequence. .binary Search() : Returns the index of an element if it was found in a sorted array. Binary search is a type of search technique that takes advantage of the fact that an array is sorted. The general idea is to continually bisect the
