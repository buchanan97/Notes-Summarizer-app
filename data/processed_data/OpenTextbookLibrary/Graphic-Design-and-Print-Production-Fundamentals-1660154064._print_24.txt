and full background photography . Photogr aph y ITS did not use illustrations and drawings because of their inherent subjectivity . Photography was preferred because of its objective qualities, and was heavily used to balance and or ganically complement the typography and its structured or ganizational grid. Often the photograph sat in the background with the type designed to sit within it; the two composed to strengthen each other to create a cohesive whole. ITS refined the presentation of information to allow the content to be understood clearly and cleanly , without persuading influences of any kind. A strong focus on order and clarity was desirable as design was seen to be a socially useful and important activity the designers define their roles not as artists but as objective conduits for spreading important information between components of society (Meggs Purvis, , p. ). Josef M ller -Brockmann, another one of its pioneers, sought an absolute and universal form of graphic expression through objective and impersonal presentation, communicating to the audience without the interference of the designer s subjective feelings or propagandistic techniques of persuasion (Schneider , 2011).M ller -Brockmann s posters and design works feature lar ge photographs as objective symbols meant to convey his ideas in particularly clear and powerful ways. After W orld W ar II, international trade began to increase and relations between countries grew steadily stronger . Typography and design were crucial to helping these relationships progress multiple languages had to be factored into a design. While clarity , objectivity , region-less glyphs, and symbols were essential to communication between international partners, ITS found its niche in this communicative climate and expanded beyond Switzerland, to America.
