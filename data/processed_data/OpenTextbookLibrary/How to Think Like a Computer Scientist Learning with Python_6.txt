It wa s the clearest and most helpful computer science text I had seen. It emphasized the processes of thought involved in programming rather than the features of a particular language. Reading it immediately made me a better teacher. How to Think Like a Computer Scientist was not just an excellent book, but it had been released under a GNU public license, which meant it could be used freely and modi ed to meet the needs of its user. Once I decided to use Python, it occurred to me that I could translate Allen s original Java version of the book into the new language. While I would not have been able to write a textbook on my own, having Allen s book to work from made it possible for me to do so, at the same time demonstrating that the cooperative development model used so well in software could also work for educational content. Working on this book for the last two years has been rewarding for both my students and me, and my students played a big part in the process. Since I could ix make instant changes whenever someone found a spelling error or di cult passage, I encouraged them to look for mistakes in the book by giving them a bonus point each time they made a suggestion that resulted in a change in the text. This had the double bene t of encouraging them to read the text more carefully and of getting the text thoroughly reviewed by its most important critics, students using it to learn computer science. For the second half of the book on object-oriented programming, I knew that someone with more
