one level, you will be learning to write Java programs, a useful skill by itself. But on another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer. What Is a Computer? When people hear the wordcomputer, they often think of a desktop or a laptop. Not surprisingly, searching for computer on Google Images (https: images.google.com ) displays rows and rows of these types of machines. However, in a more general sense, a computer can be any type of device that stores and processes data. Chapter Computer Programming Dictionary.com defines a computer as a programmable electronic device designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations. Mainframes, desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones are some of the different types of computers. Each type of computer has its own unique design, but internally they all share the same type ofhardware. The two most important hardware components areprocessors(or CPUs) that perform simple calculations andmemory (or RAM) that temporarily stores information. Figure shows what these components look like. Figure : Example processor and memory hardware. Users generally see and interact with touchscreens, keyboards, and monitors, but it s the processors and memory that perform the actual computation. Nowadays it s fairly standard, even for a smartphone, to have at least eight processors and four gigabytes (four billion cells) of memory. What Is Programming? Aprogramis a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation on computer hardware. The computation might be something mathematical, like solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial. It could also be
