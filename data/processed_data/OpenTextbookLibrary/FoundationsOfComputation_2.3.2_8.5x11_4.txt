particular statement, which is either true or false (although I am not at the moment making any assumption about which it is). The discussion ha smathematical generality in thatpcan represent any statement, and the discussion will be valid no matter which statement it represents. What we do with propositions is combine them with logical operators . A logical operator can be applied to one or more propositions t o produce a new proposition. Thetruthvalueofthenewpropositioniscompl etelydeterminedby the operator and by the truth values of the propositions to wh ich it is applied. It is not always true that the truth value of a sentence can be determin ed from the truth values of its component parts. For example, if pis a proposition, then Sarah Palin believes p is also a proposition, so Sarah Palin believes is some kind of operat or. However, it does not count as a logicaloperator because just from knowing whether or not pis true, we get no information at all about whether Sarah Palin believes p is true. . PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC In English, logical operators are represented by words such as and, or, and not. For example, the proposition I wanted to leave and I l eft is formed from two simpler propositions joined by the word and. Addi ng the word not to the proposition I left gives I did not leave (aft er a bit of necessary grammatical adjustment). But English is a little too rich for mathematical logic.
