produces sound. Microphones and speakers are called transducers because they transduce, or convert, signals from one form to another. This book is about signal processing, which includes processes for synthesizing, transforming, and analyzing signals. I will focus on sound signals, but the same methods apply to electronic signals, mechanical vibration, and signals in many other domains. They also apply to signals that vary in space rather than time, like elevation along a hiking trail. And they apply to signals in more than one dimension, like an image, which you can think of as a signal that varies in two-dimensional space. Or a movie, which is a signal that varies in two-dimensional space and time. But we start with simple one-dimensional sound. The code for this chapter is in chap01.ipynb , which is in the repository for this book (see Section ). You can also view it at http: tinyurl.com thinkdsp01 . Chapter . Sounds and signals Time (s) Figure : Segment from a recording of a bell. Periodic signals We'll start with periodic signals , which are signals that repeat themselves after some period of time. For example, if you strike a bell, it vibrates and generates sound. If you record that sound and plot the transduced signal, it looks like Figure . This signal resembles a sinusoid , which means it has the same shape as the trigonometric sine function. You can see that this signal is periodic. I chose the duration to show three full repetitions, also known as cycles . The duration of each cycle, called the period , is about ms. Thefrequency of a signal is the number of cycles per second, which is the inverse
