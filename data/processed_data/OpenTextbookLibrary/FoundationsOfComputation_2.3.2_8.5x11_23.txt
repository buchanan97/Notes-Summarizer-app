the law as it is stated in Figure . Often, there are several rules that apply, and there are no de nite guidelines about which one you shoul d try. This is what makes algebra something of an art. It is certainly not true that all possible rules of Boolean al gebra are given in Figure . For one thing, there are many rules that are easy consequenc es of the rules that are listed there. For example, although the table asserts only that F p p, it is also true that p F p. This can be checked directly or by a simple calculation: p F F p Commutative Law p Identity Law as given in the table Additional rules can be obtained by applying the Commutativ e Law to other rules in the table, and we will use such rules freely in the fut ure. Another sort of easy extension can be applied to the Associat ive Law, ( p q) r p (q r). The law is stated for the operator applied to three terms, but it generalizes to four or more terms. For example ((p q) r) s (p q) (r s) by the Associative Law for three terms p (q (r s)) by the Associative Law for three terms We will, of course, often write this expression as p q r s, with no parentheses at all, knowing that wherever we put the parentheses the valu e is the same. One other thing that you should keep in mind is that rules can b e applied in either direction. The Distributive Law, for example, all ows you to distribute thepinp (q p) to get (
