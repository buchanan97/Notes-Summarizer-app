view that models can be useful even if the entities they postulate don't exist. George Box wrote what might be the motto of instrumentalism: All models are wrong, but some are useful." Reductionism!holism Reductionism is the view that the behavior of a system can be explained by understanding its components. For example, the periodic table of the elements is a triumph of reductionism, because it explains the chemical behavior of elements with a model of electrons in atoms. Holism is the view that some phenomena that appear at the system level do not exist at the level of components, and cannot be explained in component-level terms. We get back to explanatory models in Chapter , instrumentalism in Chapter , and holism in Chapter . Complexity engineering Complexity engineering I have been talking about complex systems in the context of science, but complexity is also a cause, and e ect, of changes in engineering and the design of social systems: Centralized!decentralized Centralized systems are conceptually simple and easier to analyze, but decentralized systems can be more robust. For example, in the World Wide Web clients send requests to centralized servers; if the servers are down, the service is unavailable. In peer-topeer networks, every node is both a client and a server. To take down the service, you have to take down every node. One-to-many!many-to-many In many communication systems, broadcast services are being augmented, and sometimes replaced, by services that allow users to communicate with each other and create, share, and modify content. Top-down!bottom-up In social, political and economic systems, many activities that would normally be centrally organized now operate as grassroots movements. Even armies, which are the canonical example of hierarchical
