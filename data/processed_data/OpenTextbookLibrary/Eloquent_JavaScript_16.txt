A bigger issue is representing nonwhole numbers. To do this, some of the bits are used to store the position of the decimal point. The actual maximum whole number that can be stored is more in the range of quadrillion ( zeros) which is still pleasantly huge. Fractional numbers are written using a dot: For very big or very small numbers, you may also use scientific notation by adding an e(for exponent ), followed by the exponent of the number. .998e8 That s , , . Calculations with whole numbers (also called integers) that are smaller than the aforementioned quadrillion are guaranteed to always be precise. Unfortunately, calculations with fractional numbers are generally not. Just as (pi) cannot be precisely expressed by a finite number of decimal digits, many numbers lose some precision when only bits are available to store them. This is a shame, but it causes practical problems only in specific situations. The important thing is to be aware of it and treat fractional digital numbers as approximations, not as precise values. Arithmetic The main thing to do with numbers is arithmetic. Arithmetic operations such asadditionormultiplicationtaketwonumbervaluesandproduceanewnumber from them. Here is what they look like in Java Script: The and symbols are called operators . The first stands for addition and the second stands for multiplication. Putting an operator between two values will apply it to those values and produce a new value. Does this example mean Add and , and multiply the result by , or is the multiplication done before the adding? As you might have guessed, the multiplication happens first. As in mathematics, you can change this by wrapping the addition in parentheses. ( ) For
