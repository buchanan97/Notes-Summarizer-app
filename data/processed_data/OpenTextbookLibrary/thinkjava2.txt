Contents vi CONTENTS Preface Think Javais an introduction to computer science and programming intended for readers with little or no experience. We start with the most basic concepts and are careful to define all terms when they are first used. The book presents each new idea in a logical progression. Larger topics, like control flow statements and object-oriented programming, are divided into smaller examples and introduced over the course of several chapters. This book is intentionally concise.

We begin with small problems and basic algorithms and work up to object-oriented design. In the vocabulary of computer science pedagogy, this book uses the objects late approach.
