be implemented as bits shi fts and addition. But because it can be done does not mean it should be done. In HLL (C C , Java, C , etc.) this type of code is arcane, and difficult to read and understand. In addition, any decent compiler will convert constant multiplication into th e correct unde rlying bit shifts and additions when it is more efficient to do so. And the compiler will make better decisions about when to use this method of multiplication, and implement it more effectively and with fewer errors than if a programmer wer e to do it. So unless there is some really good reason to do multiplication using bit shifts and addition, it should be avoided in a HLL. INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING Chapter . Integer division using bit shift operations Since multiplication can be implemented using bit shift operations, the o bvious question is whether or not the same principal applies to division? The answer is that for some useful cases, division using bit shift operations does work. But in general, it is full of problems. The cases where division using bit shift operations works are when the dividend is positive, and the divisor is a power of . For example, 00011001 ( ) divided by would be a -bit shift , or 00001100 ( ). The answer is truncated, as this is easily implemented by throwing away the bit which has been shifted out. Likewise, 011001 ( ) divided by is 00000011 ( ), with truncation again occurring. Note also that in this case the bit that is shifted in is the sign bit, which is necessary to maintain
