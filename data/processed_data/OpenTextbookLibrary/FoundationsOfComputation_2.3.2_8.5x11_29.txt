needn t concern us here.) A wire in a computer can be in one of two states, which we can thi nk of as being onando . These two states can be naturally associated with the Boolean values Tand F. When a computer computes, the multitude of wires inside it are turned on and o in patterns that are determined by certain rules. The rules involved can be most naturally expressed in terms o f logic. A simple rule might be, turn wire Con whenever wire Ais on and wire Bis on. This rule can be implemented in hardware as an AND gate . Anandgate is an electronic component with two input wires and one output wir e, whose job is to turn its output on when both of its inputs are on and to turn i ts output o in any other case. If we associate on with Tand o with F, and if we give the names Aand Bto the inputs of the gate, then the gate computes the value of the logical expression A B. In e ect, Ais a proposition with the meaning the rst input is on, and Bis a proposition with the meaning the second input is on. The andgate functions to ensure that the output is described by the proposition A B. That is, the output is on if and only if the rst input is on and the second input is on. .
