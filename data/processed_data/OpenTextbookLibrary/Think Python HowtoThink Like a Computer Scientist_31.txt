a collection of related functions. Before we can use the functions in a module, we have to import it with an import statement : import math This statement creates a module object named math. If you display the module object, you get some information about it: math module 'math '(built-in) The module object contains the functions and variables de ned in the module. To access one of the functions, you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is called dot notation . ratio signal power noise power decibels math.log10(ratio) radians height math.sin(radians) The rst example uses math.log10 to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels (assuming that signal power and noise power are de ned). The math module also provides log, which computes logarithms base e. The second example nds the sine of radians . The variable name radians is a hint that sin and the other trigonometric functions ( cos,tan, etc.) take arguments in radians. To convert from degrees to radians, divide by and multiply by p: degrees radians degrees math.pi math.sin(radians) The expression math.pi gets the variable pifrom the math module. Its value is a oatingpoint approximation of p, accurate to about digits. If you know trigonometry, you can check the previous result by comparing it to the square root of two, divided by two: math.sqrt( ) . Composition Composition So far, we have looked at the elements of a program variables, expressions, and statements in isolation, without talking about how to combine them. One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small building blocks
