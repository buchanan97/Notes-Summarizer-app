choices is the number of entries that appear in the two lists combined, which is five plus three. In other words, to determine the number of choices you have, we add the number of choices of doughnut (that is, the number of entries in the first list) and the number of choices of bagel (that is, the number of entries in the second list). This is an example of the sum rule . We re now ready to state the sum rule in its full generality. THEOREM (Sum Rule). Suppose that when you are determining the total number of outcomes, you can identify two distinct cases with the property that every possible outcome lies in exactly one of the cases. If there are n1possible outcomes in the first case, and n2possible outcomes in the second case, then the total number of possible outcomes wil l be n1 n2. It s hard to do much with the sum rule by itself, but we ll cover a couple of additional examples and then in the next section, we ll get into some more challenging examples where we combine the two rules. Sometimes the problem naturally splits into more than two cases, with every possible outcome lying in exactly one of the cases. If this happens, we can apply the sum rule more than once to determine the answer. First we identify two cases (one of which may be everything else ), and then subdivide one or both of the cases. Let s look at an example of this. EXAMPLE . Iswar is planning to flip his coin up to three times. What are the possible combinations of heads and tails he might
