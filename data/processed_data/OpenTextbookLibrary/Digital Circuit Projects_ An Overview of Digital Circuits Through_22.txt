for an adult audience or at least adult supervision. The parts are small, pointy and sharp, and care should be used when handling them. Clipping and stripping wires can result in small pieces of plastic and metal becoming airborne. The components used in these circuits can become very hot , especially if installed backwards . While there is nothing inherently dangerous in working with the circu its, c are should be used. S afety glasses are recommended , and if any chip or part of the circuit become hot, quickly remove the power by disconnecting the battery. Do not touch any hot chips or other components, and w ait for chips or other components to cool before handling them . Conclusion Computers are machines . They are amazing machines, but they are still simply machines. This book will start to demystify computers by defining the basic components which make up a compu tation machine. It will do this by allowing the reader to develop the basic components which make up a computer, both virtually in software and physically in hardware. DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS Chapter Background Material Introduction This chapter introduces the necessary Boolean algebra for understanding circuits. It covers truth tables, Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) for Boolean functions, Boolean relationships, how to use Boolean Algebra to manipulate and reduce Boolean functions, and how to use Karnaugh maps to minimize Boolean func tions. While the material in this chapter can be understood by someone with a good understanding of algebra, it can be a bit esoteric and is not needed to understand the rest of the textbook. This chapter can be safely skipped by someone using
