of is . Example: Division and Modulo The followin g example program uses division and modulo to obtain the last two digits of an integer. The output follows the listing. Listing : Obtain the last two digits of an integer public class Integer Arithmetic public static void main(String args) Use integer arithmetic Division: no remainder Modulo: yields the remainder int number, digit; number 1297; Get right -most digit digit number ; System.out.println(digit); Decrease number by a factor of and get next digit number number ; digit number ; System.out.println(digit); Figure : Last two digits Defau lt Integer Data Type If a numeric literal has no decimal point (such as 10025 ) then the data type used is int. If a programmer wanted to use the long data type the value would have a suffix of L or l; for example, 10025 L . L is recommended since the lowerc ase l appears too much like digit . We say int is the default integer data type. Exercises . We have seen some simple expressions in Java. Modify the program in Listing to use a simple expression. Alter the statement i ; to the following (so th e value in i is multiplied by ): i i ; This statement causes i to be multiplied by and the result is stored back in i. . Modify the program in Listing so that each of the four digits are displayed on separate lines. . Write a program to determine what happens when: (a) is added to the largest int value, (b) is subtracted from the smallest int value, (c) an integer is divided by zero. . What values are produced by the
