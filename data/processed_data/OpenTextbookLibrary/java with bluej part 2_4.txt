we require a loop to accomplish this: s and t are of the same type for (int i ; i t. length ; i ) s i t i ; You can re-instantiate an array variable. New locations are assigned to the array (see below) and the old ones are reclaimed for reuse according to an internal Java garbage collection procedure. . STORAGE OF ARRAYS AND COPYING ARRAYS CHAPTER . ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS The enhanced for There is a variation on the for called the enhanced for that can be used when a program iterates from the rst element through to the last element of an array and does not change any values. The syntax is for ( type variable :array ) statement The forstatement in the previous example can be rewritten: for (int days : days In Month ) System . out. print ( days " "); Example Calculating an average Consider the following program where temperature is assigned values obtained from a user and then the average temperature is displayed. The assignments must be done using a forwhereas the calculation of the sum can be done with a enhanced for. Listing : Initializing an array from input. 1import java . util . Scanner ; Display average of values 5public class Average Temperature public static void main ( String args ) Scanner kb new Scanner ( System .in); double temperature new double ; System . out. println (" Enter temperatures :"); for (int i ; i ; i ) temperature i kb. next Double (); double sum ; for ( double t: temperature ) sum t; System . out. println (" average " sum ) ; .
