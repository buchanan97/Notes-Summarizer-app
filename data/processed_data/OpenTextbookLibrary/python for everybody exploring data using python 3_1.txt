to skillfully use technolog y in their chosen eld. I never seemed to nd the perfect data-oriented Python book for my course, so I set out to write just such a book. Luckily at a faculty meeting three weeks befor e I was about to start my new book from scratch over the holiday break, Dr. At ul Prakash showed me the Think Python book which he had used to teach his Python course that semester. It is a well-written Computer Science text with a focus on short, direct explanations and ease of learning. The overall book structure has been changed to get to doing data analysis problems as quickly as possible and have a series of running examples and exercises about data analysis from the very beginning. Chapters are similar to the Think Python book, but there have been major changes. Number-oriented examples and exercises have been replaced with dataoriented exercises. Topics are presented in the order needed to build increasingly sophisticated data analysis solutions. Some topics like tryandexcept are pulled forward and presented as part of the chapter on conditionals. Functions are given very light treatment until they are needed to handle program complexity rather than introduced as an early lesson in abstraction. Nearly all user-de ned functions have been removed from the example code and exercises outside of Chapter . The word recursion 1does not appear in the book at all. In chapters and , all of the material is brand new, focusing on real-worl d uses and simple examples of Python for data analysis including regular expressions for searching and parsing, automating tasks on your computer, retrieving data across the network, scraping web pages for data,
