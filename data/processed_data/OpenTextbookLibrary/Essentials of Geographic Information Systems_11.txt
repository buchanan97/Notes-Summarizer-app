other geographic data through a pr ocess called geocoding. There are several free online geocoders (e.g., http: worldkit.org geocoder ) that return the latitude and longitude for various locations and addresses around the world. With the advent of the global positioning system (GPS) (see also http: www.gps.gov ), determining the location of nearly any object on the surface of the earth is a relatively simple and straightforward exercise. GPS technology consists of a constellation of twenty -four satellites that are orbiting the earth and constantly transmitting time signals (see Figure "Constellation of Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellites" ). To determine a position, earth- based GP S units (e.g., handheld devices, car navigation systems, mobile phones) receive the signals from at least three of these satellites and use this information to triangulate a location. All GPS units use the geographic coordinate system (GCS) to report location. Originally developed by the United States Department of Defense for military purposes, there are now a wide range of commercial and scientific uses of a GPS.

Relative location refers to defining and describing places in relation to other known locations. For instance, Cairo, Egypt, is north of Johannesburg, South Africa; New Zealand is southeast of Australia; and Kabul, Afghanistan , is northwest of Lahore, Pakistan. Unlike nominal or absolute locations that define single points, relative locations provide a bit more information and situate one place in relation to another. Direction Like location, the concept of direction is central to geography and GISs. Direction refers to the position of something relative to something else
