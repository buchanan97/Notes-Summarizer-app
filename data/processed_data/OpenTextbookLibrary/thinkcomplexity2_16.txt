uncontroversial. These trends are both cause and e ect of complexity science. For example, highly abstracted models are more acceptable now because of the diminished expectation that there should be a unique, correct model for every system. Conversely, developments in complex systems challenge determinism and the related concept of physical law. This chapter is an overview of the themes coming up in the book, but not all of it will make sense before you see the examples. When you get to the end of the book, you might nd it helpful to read this chapter again. Chapter Complexity Science Chapter Graphs The next three chapters are about systems made up of components and connections between components. For example, in a social network, the components are people and connections represent friendships, business relationships, etc. In an ecological food web, the components are species and the connections represent predator-prey relationships. In this chapter, I introduce Network X, a Python package for building models of these systems. We start with the Erd os-R enyi model, which has interesting mathematical properties. In the next chapter we move on to models that are more useful for explaining real-world systems. The code for this chapter is in chap02.ipynb in the repository for this book. More information about working with the code is in Section . What is a graph? To most people a graph" is a visual representation of data, like a bar chart or a plot of stock prices over time. That's not what this chapter is about. In this chapter, a graph is a representation of a system that contains discrete, interconnected elements. The elements are represented by nodes also called vertices and the
