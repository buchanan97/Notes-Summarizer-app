Piece object might have a pair of row andcolumn attributes that specify its position on the chess board. Notice that an object s attributes are themselves objects. The ATM s cash attribute and the chess piece s row andcolumn attributes are Number s. Figure shows two ATM objects and their respective attributes. As you can see, an object s attributes are listed in a second partition of the UML diagram. Notice that each attribute has a value. So the lobby:ATM has a in cash , while the drivethru:ATM has only in cash . Figure : A second partition of an object diagram is used to display the object s attributes and their values. We sometimes refer to the collection of an object s attributes and values as its state . For example, the current state of the lobby:ATM is in cash. Of course, this is a gross simpli cation of an ATM s state, which would also include many other attributes. But, hopefully, you see the point. Actions and Messages In addition to their attributes, objects also have characteristic actions or behaviors. As we have already said, objects in programs are dynamic. They do things or have things done to them. In fact, programming in Java is largely a matter of getting objects to perform certain actions for us. For example, in a chess program the Chess Piece s have the ability to move To() a new position on the chess board. Similarly, when a customer pushes the Current Balance button on an ATM machine, this is telling the ATM to report() the customer s current bank balance. (Note how we use parentheses to distinguish actions from objects and attributes.)
