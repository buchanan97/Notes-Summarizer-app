say that double and int are the default numeric data types. We focus on these numeric data types for the rest of this text. Exercises . Modify the program in Listing to calculate and display fuel consumption as the number of kilometres travelled per litre of fuel. . Write a program that converts a value in centimetres to an equivalent value in inches. Use the conversion: one inch equals centimetres. Use variables of type double . . Write a program that converts a value in dollars to an equivalent value in euros. Use the conversion: one euro equals d ollars. Use variables of type double . . Modify Listing to run some different calculations, such as: System.out.println( - ); System.out.println( - ); Numeric Expressions Calculations arise in almost every computerized application. For instance, calculating gross pay calculating tax payable resizing of text on a computer monitor direction of a ball when it strikes a border Calculations are defined using Java expressions which c omprise operators and operands: operators we consider are ad dition, subtraction, multip lication, division, and modulo represented by , -, , , and respectively. All of these operators are binary operators, meaning that they have two operands. Expressions involving these are written in an infix manner where one operand is on the left of the operator and the other operand in on the right of the operator. operands are either literals, variables, or sub -expressions. Sub-expressions are expressions enclosed in parentheses, ( and ). Some examples of expressions, goi ng from simple to more complex are: Some Java Expressions c c (f - ) Expressions numbered , and above are complex , and to fully understand how
