a bug. The change need not be the one you suggested, and the bug need not be technical in nature. Unclear writing quali es, for example. Features of the Text Each chapter concludes with ve standard elements. The last numbered section within the chapter is always devoted to security matters related to the chapter's topic. Next comes three di erent lists of opportunities for active participation by the student: exercises, programming projects, and exploration projects. Finally, the chapter ends with historical and bibliographic notes. The distinction between exercises, programming projects, and exploration projects needs explanation. An exercise can be completed with no PREFACE xvii outside resources beyond paper and pencil: you need just this textbook and your mind. That does not mean all the exercises are cut and dried, however. Some may call upon you to think creatively; for these, no one answer is correct. Programming projects require a nontrivial amount of programming; that is, they require more than making a small, easily identi ed change in an existing program. However, a programming project may involve other activities beyond programming. Several of them involve scienti c measurement of performance e ects, for example; these exploratory aspects may even dominate over the programming aspects. An exploration project, on the other hand, can be an experiment that can be performed with no real programming; at most you might change a designated line within an existing program. The category of exploration projects does not just include experimental work, however. It also includes projects that require you to do research on the Internet or using other library resources.
