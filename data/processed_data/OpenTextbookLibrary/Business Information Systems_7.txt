in no particular order. Students need to discover what they need to accomplish and then look up the techniques that will help to get them there. Over the years, we have learned that students can learn a te chnique very quickly, but this is not what they truly need to understand. They need to know when to apply the technique, and this pedagogy focuses on developing that intuition. Sometimes, we show before and after examples of the required deliverable. Stude nts are challenged to transform the before into the after using the techniques. We expressly avoid the step by step exercises found in many other texts. Our experience is that students will focus on keystrokes rather than concepts when presented with step by step instructions. Our model is closer to just in time learning found in many MBA programs. It is also a model for life -long learning, rather than learning specific software tools. Conclusion We have learned a lot over five years developing this book, a nd continue to learn every day as we move forward. We would like to thank our students who have helped guide us with their feedback.
