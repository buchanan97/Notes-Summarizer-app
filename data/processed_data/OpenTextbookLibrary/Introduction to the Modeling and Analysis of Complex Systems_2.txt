Knowledge of basic mathematics is presumed of the reader who is given glimpses into the vast, diverse and rich world of nonlinear algebraic and differential equations that model various real-world phenomena. The treatment of the eld is thorough and comprehensive, and the book is written in a very lucid and student-oriented fashion. A distinguishing feature of the book, which uses the freely available software Python, is numerous examples and hands-on exercises on complex system modeling, with the student being encouraged to develop and test his or her own code in order to gain vital experience. The book is divided into three parts. Part I provides a basic introduction to the art and science of model building and gives a brief historical overview of complex system modeling. Part II is concerned with systems having a small number of variables. After introducing the reader to the important concept of phase space of a dynamical system, it covers the modeling and analysis of both discrete- and continuous-time systems in a systematic fashion. A very interesting feature of this part is the analysis of the behavior of such a system around its equilibrium state, small perturbations around which can lead to bifurcations
