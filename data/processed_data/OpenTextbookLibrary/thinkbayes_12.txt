w e'll start with probabilit y , then conditional probabilit y , then Ba y es's theorem, and on to Ba y esian statistics. A probabilit y is a n um b er b et w een and (including b oth) that represen ts a degree of b elief in a fact or prediction. The v alue represen ts certain t y that a fact is true, or that a prediction will come true. The v alue represen ts certain t y that the fact is false. In termediate v alues represen t degrees of certain t y . The v alue , often written as , means that a predicted outcome is as lik ely to happ en as not. F or example, the probabilit y that a tossed coin lands face up is v ery close to . A conditional probabilit y is a probabilit y based on some bac kground information. F or example, I w an t to kno w the probabilit y that I will ha v e a heart attac k in the next y ear. A ccording to the CDC, Ev ery y ear ab out , Americans ha v e a rst coronary attac k. ( http: www.cdc.gov heartdisease facts.htm ) The U.S. p opulation is ab out million, so the probabilit y that a randomly c hosen American will ha v e a heart attac k in the next y ear is roughly . But I am not a randomly c hosen American. Epidemiologists ha v e iden ti ed man y factors that a ect the risk of heart attac ks; dep ending on those factors, m y risk migh
