print( 'Hello, World! ') This is an example of a print statement , although it doesn t actually print anything on paper. It displays a result on the screen. In this case, the result is the words Hello, World! The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the text to be displayed; they don t appear in the result. The parentheses indicate that print is a function. We ll get to functions in Chapter . In Python , the print statement is slightly different; it is not a function, so it doesn t use parentheses. print 'Hello, World! ' This distinction will make more sense soon, but that s enough to get started. Arithmetic operators After Hello, World , the next step is arithmetic. Python provides operators , which are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication. The operators ,-, and perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication, as in the following examples: - The operator performs division: You might wonder why the result is instead of . I ll explain in the next section. Finally, the operator performs exponentiation; that is, it raises a number to a power: In some other languages, is used for exponentiation, but in Python it is a bitwise operator called XOR. If you are not familiar with bitwise operators, the result will surprise you: I won t cover bitwise operators in this book, but you can read about them at http: wiki. python.org moin Bitwise Operators . Chapter . The way of the program Values and types Avalue is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number. Some values we have seen so
