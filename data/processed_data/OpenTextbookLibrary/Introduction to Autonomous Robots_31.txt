be visualized by a point on a unit hyper-sphere. Given a vector p R3that should be rotated by a unit Quaternion q, we can compute the new vector p as p qpq ( ) withq the conjugate of qas defined above. . Coordinate Systems and Frames of Reference Computing the equivalent rotation to two subsequent rotations, requires multiplying the Quaternions. Given two quaternions and , multiplication is defined by the following matrix multiplication: 4 1 2 3 1 4 3 2 2 3 4 1 3 2 1 4 ( ) Unlike multiplying two rotation matrices, which requires multiplications and additions, multiplying two quaternions only requires multiplications and additions, making the operation computationally more efficient. Importantly, this representation does not suffer from singularities for specific joint angles, making the approach computationally more robust. This is particularly relevant for robotics, as mathematical singularities have pretty significant real-world impact on physical robots. Take-home lessons In order to perform planning for a robot, it is necessary to understand how its control parameters map to actions in the physical world. The kinematics of a robot are fully defined by the position and orientation of its wheels, joints and links no matter whether it swims, flies, crawls or drives. Many robotic systems cannot be fully understood by considering kinematics alone, but require you to model their dynamics as well. This book will be limited to modeling kinematics, which is sufficient for low-speed mobile robots and arms. Exercises . What are the Cartesian Do Fs of a push lawnmower with four wheels? How is it still possible to mow an entire lawn with one, even though the wheels don t yaw? . Is a car statically
