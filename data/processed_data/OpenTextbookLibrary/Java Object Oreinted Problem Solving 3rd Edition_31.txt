a cookie, a class gives the general shape of an object. The content is not included. Variables and Methods Up to this point we have been using the terms attribute and action to describe an object s features. We will continue to use this terminology when talking in general about objects or when talking about an object or class represented by a UML diagram. However, when talking about a programming language, the more common way to describe an object s features are to talk about its variables and methods. A variable , which corresponds to an attribute, is a named memory location that can store a certain type of value. You can think of a variable as a special container that can only hold objects of a certain type. For example, as Figure shows, Rectangle slength andwidth are SECTION What Is Object-Oriented Programming? variables that can store a certain type of numeric value known as an int. Anint value is a whole number, such as or - . Amethod , which corresponds to an action or a behavior, is a named chunk of code that can be called upon or invoked to perform a certain pre-de ned set of actions. For example, in our Rectangle object, the calculate Area() method can be called upon to calculate the rectangle s area. It would do this, of course, by multiplying the rectangle s length by its width. Similarly, the draw() method can be invoked to draw a picture of the rectangle. It would take the actions necessary to draw a rectangle on the console. Instance versus Class Variables and Methods Variables and methods can be associated either with objects or their classes.
