The reference models Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org courses cs402 The Saylor Foundation Computer Networking : Principles, Protocols and Practice, Release The OSI reference model Compared to the ve layers reference model explained above, the OSI reference model de ned in X200 is divided in seven layers. The four lower layers are similar to the four lower layers described above. The OSI reference model re ned the application layer by dividing it in three layers : the Session layer. The Session layer contains the protocols and mechanisms that are necessary to organize and to synchronize the dialogue and to manage the data exchange of presentation layer entities. While one of the main functions of the transport layer is to cope with the unreliability of the network layer, the session s layer objective is to hide the possible failures of transport-level connections to the upper layer higher. For this, the Session Layer provides services that allow to establish a session-connection, to support orderly data exchange (including mechanisms that allow to recover from the abrupt release of an underlying transport connection), and to release the connection in an orderly manner. the Presentation layer was designed to cope with the different ways of representing information on computers. There are many differences in the way computer store information. Some computers store integers as bits eld, others use bits eld and the same problem arises with oating point number. For textual information, this is even more complex with the many different character codes that have been used6. The situation is even more complex when considering the exchange of structured information such as database records. To solve this problem, the Presentation layer contains provides for a
