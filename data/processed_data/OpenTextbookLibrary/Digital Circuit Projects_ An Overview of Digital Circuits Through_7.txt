The coverage of the material is at a sufficiently deep level that the text could be used as a supplemental text for a class in Computer Organization, but the material should be easily understandable by a hobbyist who wants a better understanding of how a computer works. I. Why this book? This book is designed to address three issues. The first is that textbooks are far too expensive. As having completed my th book shows, I understand the large amount of effort that g oes into writing, editing, producin g, and distributing these books. But the work involved no
