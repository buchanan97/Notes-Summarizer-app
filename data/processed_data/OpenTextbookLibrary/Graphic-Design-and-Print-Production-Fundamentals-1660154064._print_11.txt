Typography was naturally small scale needed only for sheets and pages and was only lar ge when it was chiseled into buildings and monuments.

Agrarian-based society was tied to an aristocracy overseeing the land and controlling and directing production through the use of human labour . In contrast, urban production, though still very much in need of human labour (female and child labour in particular was in huge demand), was dominated by the mechanized production of goods, directed and controlled by industrialists instead of the aristocracy . The factories were powered initially by steam, and eventually by gasoline and electricity . These new manufacturing models were dominated by an engineering mentality that valued optimization of mechanical processes for high yields and introduced a compartmentalized approach to production. Design and Production Separ ate The design process was separated from the production-based process for a number of reasons. Primary was the ef ficiency-oriented mindset of the manufacturers who were focused on creating products with low unit costs and high yield outcomes, rather
