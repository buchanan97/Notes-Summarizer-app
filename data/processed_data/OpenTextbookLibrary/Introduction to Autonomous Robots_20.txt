rigorous mathematical treatment (see Chapter ). The goal of this section is to introduce the degrees of freedom of standard mechanisms that are recurrent in robot design such as wheels or simple arms. For wheeled platforms, the degrees-of-freedom are defined by the types of wheels used and their orientation. Common wheel types are listed in Table . Only robots that use exclusively use wheels with three degrees-of-freedom . Locomotion, manipulation and their representations Center of Gravity Pitch axis Yaw axis Roll axis Figure . Pitch, yaw, and roll around the principal axis of an airplane. . Degrees of freedom Wheel type Example Degrees of Freedom Standard Front-wheel of a wheelbarrow Two: Rotation around the wheel axle Rotation around its contact point with the ground Caster wheel Office chair Three: Rotation around the wheel axle Rotation around its contact point with the ground Rotation around the caster axis Swedish wheel Standard wheel with nonactuated rollers around its circumference Three: Rotation around the wheel axle Rotation around its contact point with the ground Rotation around the roller axles Spherical wheel Ball Bearing Three: Rotation in any direction Rotation around its contact point Table . Different types of wheels and their degrees of freedom. Adopted from Siegwart et al. (2011). . Locomotion, manipulation and their representations ( -Do F wheels) will be able to freely move on a plane. This is because the pose of a robot on a plane is fully determined by its position (two values, e.g. vertical and horizontal position) and its orientation (one value, e.g. an angle). Robots that don t have wheels with three degrees of freedom will have kinematic constraints that prevent them from reaching every possible
