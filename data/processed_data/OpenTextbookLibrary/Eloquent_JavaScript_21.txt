on) are also included in the ordering. When comparing strings, Java Script goes over the characters from left to right, comparing the Unicode codes one by one. Other similar operators are (greater than or equal to), (less than or equal to), (equal to), and ! (not equal to). console.log("Garnet" ! "Ruby") true console.log("Pearl" "Amethyst") false There is only one value in Java Script that is not equal to itself, and that is Na N ( not a number ). console.log(Na N Na N) false Na Nis supposed to denote the result of a nonsensical computation, and as such, it isn t equal to the result of any othernonsensical computations. Logicaloperators There are also some operations that can be applied to Boolean values themselves. Java Script supports three logical operators: and,or, and not. These can be used to reason about Booleans. The operator represents logical and. It is a binary operator, and its result is true only if both the values given to it are true. console.log(true false) false console.log(true true) true The operator denotes logical or. It produces true if either of the values given to it is true. console.log(false true) true console.log(false false) false Notis written as an exclamation mark ( !). It is a unary operator that flips the value given to it !trueproduces falseand !falsegives true. When mixing these Boolean operators with arithmetic and other operators, it is not always obvious when parentheses are needed. In practice, you can usually get by with knowing that of the operators we have seen so far, has the lowest precedence, then comes , then the comparison operators ( , , and so on), and then the rest. This order has
