maneuverable, and easy to control; however, it is hard to drive the robot in a perfectly straight line. This motion requires both motors to turn at the exact same speed and both wheels to have the exact same diameter, which is hard to achieve in practice. This problem is solved well by car-like steering mechanisms . Locomotion, manipulation and their representations xyz xyz Figure . A coordinate system indicating the direction of the coordinate axes and rotation around them. These directions have been derived using the right-hand rules. which in turn have poor maneuverability and are difficult to control (as a reference, think about the complexity of parallel parking). . Coordinate Systems and Frames of Reference Every robot assumes a pose in the real world that can be described by its position ( x,y, and z) and orientation (pitch, yaw, and roll) along the three major axes of a Cartesian Coordinate system. Such a coordinate system is shown in Figure . Note that the directions and orientations of the coordinate axes are arbitrary. This book uses the right hand rule , which is illustrated in Figure to determine axes labels and directions throughout. Pitch, yaw, and roll, are also known as bank, attitude, and heading in other communities. This makes sense, considering the colloquial use of the word heading , which corresponds to a rotation around the z-axis of a vehicle driving on the x-y-plane. . Coordinate Systems and Frames of Reference Defining all three position axes and orientations might be cumbersome. What level of detail we care about, where the origin of this coordinate system is, and even what kind of coordinate system we choose, depends on the specific
