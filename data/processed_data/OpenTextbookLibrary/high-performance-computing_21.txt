permission to interchange these loops in this particular example (or , after reading this book, you could just code it properly in the first place). while ( ptr ! NULL ) ptr ptr- next; The next element that is retrieved is based on the contents of the current element. This type of loop bounces all around memory in no particular pattern. This is called pointer chasing and there are no good ways to improve the performance of this code. A third pattern often found in certain types of codes is called gather (or scatter) and occurs in loops such as: SUM SUM ARR ( IND(I) ) where the IND array contains of fsets into the ARR array . Again, like the linked list, the exact pattern of memory references is known only at runtime when the values stored in the IND array are known. Some special-purpose systems have special hardware support to accelerate this particular operation. Cache Or ganization The process of pairing memory locations with cache lines is called mapping . Of course, given that a cache is smaller than main memory , you have to share the same cache lines for dif ferent memory locations. In caches, each cache line has a record of the memory address (called the tag) it represents and perhaps when it was last used. The tag is used to track which area of memory is stored in a particular cache line. The way memory locations (tags) are mapped to cache lines can have a beneficial ef fect on the way your program runs, because if two heavily used memory locations map onto the same cache line, the miss rate will be higher than
