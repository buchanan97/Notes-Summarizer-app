of a Boolean expression. The deciding expression is written after the keyword, between parentheses, followed by the statement to execute. The Number.is Na N function is a standard Java Script function that returns trueonly if the argument it is given is Na N. The Numberfunction happens to return Na Nwhen you give it a string that doesn t represent a valid number. Thus, the condition translates to unless the Number is not-a-number, do this . The statement after the ifis wrapped in braces ( and ) in this example. The braces can be used to group any number of statements into a single statement, called a block. You could also have omitted them in this case, since they hold only a single statement, but to avoid having to think about whether they are needed, most Java Script programmers use them in every wrapped statement like this. We ll mostly follow that convention in this book, except for the occasional one-liner. if ( ) console.log("It's true"); It's true You often won t just have code that executes when a condition holds true, but also code that handles the other case. This alternate path is represented by the second arrow in the diagram. You can use the elsekeyword, together with if, to create two separate, alternative execution paths: let the Number Number(prompt("Pick a number")); if (!Number.is Na N(the Number)) console.log("Your number is the square root of " the Number the Number); else console.log("Hey. Why didn't you give me a number?"); If you have more than two paths to choose from, you can chain multiple if elsepairs together. Here s an example: let num Number(prompt("Pick a number")); if (num ) console.log("Small"); else if
