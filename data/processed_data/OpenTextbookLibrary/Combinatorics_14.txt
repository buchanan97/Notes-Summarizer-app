to be secret. For example, computer programs are transformed into long strings of binary data, that a computer reinterprets as instructions. When you text a photo to a friend, the pixel and colour information are converted into binary data to be transmitted through radio waves. When you listen to an audio file, the sound frequencies of the music have been converted into binary data that your computer decodes back into sound frequencies. Electronic encoding is always subject to interference, which can cause errors. Even when a coded message is physically etched onto a device (such as a dvd), scratches can make some parts of the code illegible. When you are connected to the internet (for example, if you are streaming), wifi signals can fail, suffer interference from other nearby networks, or become overloaded. Any of these problems can cause your connection to lose or misread part of the data that is being transmitted. People don t like it when their movies, music, or apps freeze, crash, or skip over something. This can become even more problematic if it happens during an important online meeting or class, or while you are making an electronic financial transaction. To avoid this problem, engineers use codes that allow our devices to automatically detect, and correct, minor errors that may be introduced. In coding theory, we learn how to create codes that allow for error detection and correction, without requiring excessive memory or storage capacity. Although coding theory is not a focus of this course, designs can be used to create good codes. We will learn how to make codes from designs, and what makes these codes good. EXAMPLE . Suppose we have a string
