a String variable. Output We discuss two different ways to generate output from a progr am: using System.out and JOption Pane . We discuss the use of System.out in the next two sections; in the second of these we discuss how you can redirect the output which normally appears in the Terminal Window to a file. In the third section we discuss the JOption Pane class and how that can be used to present information and data in dialog boxes. System.out A simple way to generate output for the user is to use the println( ) and print( ) methods that belong to the pre -defined Java class named System and an object within System named out. The output generated is said to go to the standard output device. When you use this type of output with Blue J you will see a window pop up named Terminal Window that contains the output produced by the program. The fo llowing program listing illustrates ways of producing output. The println( ) and print( ) methods take one argument which is a text string. Often that text string is composed of multiple catenations. Notice the last println( ) introduces special char acters for new line ( n) and tab ( t). The special characters are not displayed, they are used to control the appearance of the output.
