a separate title. The Essentials Edition will cover those topics (Chapters - ) that are covered in almost all introductory (CS1) courses, but it will also include topics (Exceptions, File I O, and Recursion) that many CS1 instructors have requested. Why Start with Objects? The Third Edition still takes an objects-early approach to teaching Java, with the assumption that teaching beginners the big picture early gives them more time to master the principles of object-oriented programming. This approach seems now to have gained in popularity as more and more instructors have begun to appreciate the advantages of the object-oriented perspective. Object Orientation (OO) is a fundamental problem solving and design concept, not just another language detail that should be relegated to the middle or the end of the book (or course). If OO concepts are introduced late, it is much too easy to skip over them when push comes to shove in the course. The rst time I taught Java in our CS1 course I followed the same approach I had been taking in teaching C and C namely, start with the basic language features and structured programming concepts and then, somewhere around midterm, introduce object orientation. This approach was familiar, for it was one taken in most of the textbooks then available in both Java and C . One problem with this approach was that many students failed to get the big picture. They could understand loops, if-else constructs, and arithmetic expressions, but they had dif culty decomposing a programming problem into a well-organized Java program. Also, it seemed that this procedural approach failed to take advantage of the strengths of Java s object orientation. Why teach an object-oriented
