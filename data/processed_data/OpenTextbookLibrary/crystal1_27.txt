may well choose the former one, so you need to understand what it means. String operations Text data, too, has many things that can be done to it. For now, let s just learn a few techniques forconcatenatingstrings (tacking . STRING OPERATIONS35 one onto the end of another)trimmingstrings (removingwhitespace1from the ends) and changing theircase(upper lower). See Figure for a list. Method operator Operation concatenate two strings .lstrip() remove leading whitespace .rstrip() remove trailing whitespace .strip() remove leading and trailing whitespace .upper() convert to all uppercase .lower() convert to all lowercase .title() convert to title case (capitalize each word) Figure :A few of Python s string methods. The plus sign is an operator, like the mathematical ones in Figure : it s used to concatenate (append) one string to another. Example: x "Lady" y "Gaga" z x y print(z) Lady Gaga The second one is slapped right on the end of the first; there s no spaces or punctuation. If you wanted to insert a space, you d havetodothatexplicitlywithastring-that-consists-of-only-a-space (written as the three characters: quote, space, quote), like this: first 'Dwayne' last "Johnson" full first ' ' last print(full) The word whitespace is a catch-all for spaces, tabs, newline characters, and most anything else invisible. CHAPTER . CALCULATIONS Dwayne Johnson Punctuation marks, too, have to be included literally, and it can be tricky to get everything typed in the right way: first 'Dwayne' last "Johnson" nick 'The Rock' full first '"' nick '"' last print("Don't ya just love ?".format(full)) Don't ya just love Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson? Stare at that line beginning with full and see if you can figure out why each punctuation mark is where it is, and why
