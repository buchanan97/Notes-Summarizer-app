result is indistinguishable from a 4500 Hz signal. For the same reason, a 7700 Hz signal is indistinguishable from 2300 Hz, and a 9900 Hz is indistinguishable from Hz. This e ect is called aliasing because when the high frequency signal is sampled, it appears to be a low frequency signal. In this example, the highest frequency we can measure is 5000 Hz, which is half the sampling rate. Frequencies above 5000 Hz are folded back below 5000 Hz, . Computing the spectrum 4500 Time (s) 5500 Figure : Cosine signals at 4500 and 5500 Hz, sampled at , frames per second. The signals are di erent, but the samples are identical. which is why this threshold is sometimes called the folding frequency". It is sometimes also called the Nyquist frequency . Seehttp: en.wikipedia. org wiki Nyquist frequency . The folding pattern continues if the aliased frequency goes below zero. For example, the 5th harmonic of the 1100 Hz triangle wave is at , Hz. Folded at 5000 Hz, it would appear at -2100 Hz, but it gets folded again at Hz, back to 2100 Hz. In fact, you can see a small peak at 2100 Hz in Figure , and the next one at 4300 Hz. Computing the spectrum We have seen the Wave method make spectrum several times. Here is the implementation (leaving out some details we'll get to later): from np.fft import rfft, rfftfreq class Wave: def make spectrum(self): n len(self.ys) Chapter . Harmonics d self.framerate hs rfft(self.ys) fs rfftfreq(n, d) return Spectrum(hs, fs, self.framerate) The parameter self is a Wave object. nis the number of samples in the wave, anddis the inverse of the frame rate,
