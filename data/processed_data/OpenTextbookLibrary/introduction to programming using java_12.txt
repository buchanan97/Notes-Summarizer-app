a list of unambiguous instructions meant to be foll owed mechanically by a computer. A computer is built to carry out instructions t hat are written in a very simple type of language called machine language . Each type of computer has its own machine language, and the computer can directly execute a program on ly if the program is expressed in that language. (It can execute programs written in other lan guages if they are rst translated into machine language.) When the CPU executes a program, that program is stored in the computer s main memory (also called the RAM or random access memory). In addition to the program, memory can also hold data that is being used or processed by th e program. Main memory consists of a sequence of locations . These locations are numbered, and the sequence number of a location is called its address . An address provides a way of picking out one particular piec e of information from among the millions stored in memory. Whe n the CPU needs to access the program instruction or data in a particular location, it sen ds the address of that information as a signal to the memory; the memory responds by sending back the value contained in the CHAPTER .

On the level of machine language, the operation of the CPU is f airly straightforward (although it is very complicated in detail). The CPU execute s a program that is stored as a sequence of machine language instructions in main memory. I
