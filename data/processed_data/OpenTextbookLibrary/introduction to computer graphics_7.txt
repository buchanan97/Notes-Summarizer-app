was able to structure the course pr imarily around Open GL , a graphics API that was in common use for an extended period. O pen GL implements fundamental graphics concepts vertices, normal vectors, coordinate transformations, lighting, and material in a way that is transparent and fairly easy to u se. Newer graphics APIs are more exible and more powerful, but they have a much steeper l earning curve. I believe that any introductory computer science course bene ts from star ting with a simpler framework or library, and Open GL serves that purpose well. Open GL is still widely supported, but, for various reasons, the parts of it that were easy to use have been o cially dropped from the latest versions (a lthough they are in practice supported on most desktop computers). Furthermore, Open GL is largely being superceded by newer graphics APIs such as Direct3 D, Metal, and Vulkan. Web GL is based on Open GL, and it will continue to be widely supported for some time. Web GPU is inspired by the newer APIs, and may at some point replace Web GL for new applications. My approach in this book is to use a subset of Open GL as the f ramework for introducing the fundamental concepts of three-dimensional graphics. I then go on to cover Web GL, the version of Open GL that runs in a web browser. In the last chapt er, I introduce Web GPU. While Open GL makes up the major foundation for the course, the real emphasis is on fundamental concepts such as geometric modeling and transformations; h ierarchical modeling and scene graphs; color, lighting, and textures; and animation.
