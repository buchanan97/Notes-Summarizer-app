to believe they have the entire memory system to themselves. Another trait of virtual memory systems is that they divide your program s memory up into pages chunks. Page sizes vary from bytes to MB or lar ger, depending on the machine. Pages don t have to be allocated contiguously , though your program sees them that way . By being separated into pages, programs are easier to arrange in memory , or move portions out to disk. Page T ables Say that your program asks for a variable stored at location 1000. In a virtual memory machine, there is no direct correspondence between your program s idea of where location 1000 is and the physical memory systems idea. T o find where your variable is actually stored, the location has to be translated from a virtual to a physical address. The map containing such translations is called a page table . Each process has a several page tables associated with it, corresponding to dif ferent regions, such as program text and data segments. To understand how address translation works, imagine the following scenario: at some point, your program asks for data from location 1000. link shows the steps required to complete the retrieval of this data. By choosing location 1000, you have identified which region the memory reference falls in, and this identifies which page table is involved. Location 1000 then helps the processor choose an entry within the table. For instance, if the page size is bytes, 1000 falls within the second page (pages range from addresses , 1023, 1024 1535, etc.). Therefore, the second table entry should hold the address of the page housing the value at
