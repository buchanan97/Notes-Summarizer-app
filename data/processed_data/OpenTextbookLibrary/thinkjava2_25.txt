the next integer is close. As an alternative, we can calculate a percentage rather than a fraction: System.out.print("Percent of the hour that has passed: "); System.out.println(minute ); The new output is as follows: Percent of the hour that has passed: Again the result is rounded down, but at least now it s approximately correct. Floating-Point Numbers A more general solution is to usefloating-pointnumbers, which represent values with decimal places. In Java, the default floating-point type is called double, which is short for double-precision . You can createdoublevariables and assign values to them the same way we did for the other types: double pi; pi ; Java performsfloating-point divisionwhen one or more operands aredouble values. So we can solve the problem from the previous section: double minute ; System.out.print("Fraction of the hour that has passed: "); System.out.println(minute ); The output is shown here: Fraction of the hour that has passed: Although floating-point numbers are useful, they can be a source of confusion. For example, Java distinguishes the integer value1from the floating-point value1. , even though they seem to be the same number. They belong to Chapter Variables and Operators different data types, and strictly speaking, you are not allowed to make assignments between types. The following is illegal because the variable on the left is anintand the value on the right is adouble: int x ; compiler error It is easy to forget this rule, because in many cases Javaautomaticallyconverts from one type to another: double y ; legal, but bad style The preceding example should be illegal, but Java allows it by converting the intvalue1tothedoublevalue1.0automatically. Thisleniencyisconvenient, but it often causes problems for beginners. For example: double y ; common mistake
