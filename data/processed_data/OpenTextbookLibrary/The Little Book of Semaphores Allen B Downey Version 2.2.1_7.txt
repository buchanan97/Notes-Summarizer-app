Semaphores x CONTENTS Chapter Introduction Synchronization In common use, synchronization means making two things ha ppen at the same time. In computer systems, synchronization is a little more general; it refers to relationships among events any number of events, a nd any kind of relationship (before, during, after). Computer programmers are often concerned with synchronization constraints , which are requirements pertaining to the order of events. E xamples include: Serialization: Event A must happen before Event B. Mutual exclusion: Events A and B must not happen at the same time. In real life we often check and enforce synchronization cons traints using a clock. How do we know if A happened before B? If we know what tim e both events occurred, we can just compare the times. In computer systems, we often need to satisfy synchronizati on constraints without the bene t of a clock, either because there is no univ ersal clock, or because we don t know with ne enough resolution when events occur.
