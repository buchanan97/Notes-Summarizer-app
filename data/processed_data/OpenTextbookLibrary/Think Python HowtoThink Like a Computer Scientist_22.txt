miles per hour? Chapter Variables, expressions and statements One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables . A variable is a name that refers to a value. Assignment statements Anassignment statement creates a new variable and gives it a value: message 'And now for something completely different ' n pi This example makes three assignments. The rst assigns a string to a new variable named message ; the second gives the integer 17ton; the third assigns the (approximate) value of ptopi. A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing to its value. This kind of gure is called a state diagram because it shows what state each of the variables is in (think of it as the variable s state of mind). Figure shows the result of the previous example. Variable names Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful they document what the variable is used for. message n pi17 And now for something completely different Figure : State diagram. Chapter . Variables, expressions and statements Variable names can be as long as you like. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they can t begin with a number. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is conventional to use only lower case for variables names. The underscore character, , can appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as your name orairspeed of unladen swallow .
