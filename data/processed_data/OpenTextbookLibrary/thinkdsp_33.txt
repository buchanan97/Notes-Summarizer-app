Hint: combine the evaluate functions from Chirp and Sawtooth Signal . Draw a sketch of what you think the spectrogram of this signal looks like, and then plot it. The e ect of aliasing should be visually apparent, and if you listen carefully, you can hear it. Exercise Make a sawtooth chirp that sweeps from 2500 to 3000 Hz, then use it to make a wave with duration s and framerate k Hz. Draw a sketch of what you think the spectrum will look like. Then plot the spectrum and see if you got it right. Exercise In musical terminology, a glissando" is a note that slides from one pitch to another, so it is similar to a chirp. Find or make a recording of a glissando and plot a spectrogram of the rst few seconds. One suggestion: George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue starts with a famous clarinet glissando, which you can download from http: archive. org details rhapblue11924 . Exercise A trombone player can play a glissando by extending the trombone slide while blowing continuously. As the slide extends, the total length of the tube gets longer, and the resulting pitch is inversely proportional to length. Assuming that the player moves the slide at a constant speed, how does frequency vary with time? Write a class called Trombone Gliss that extends Chirp and provides evaluate . Make a wave that simulates a trombone glissando from C3 up to F3 and back down to C3. C3 is Hz; F3 is Hz. . Exercises Plot
