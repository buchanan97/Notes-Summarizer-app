section. One adv an tage is that it generalizes to the case where w e dra w more than one co okie from the same b o wl (with replacemen t): dataset ' vanilla ' , ' chocolate ' , ' vanilla ' for data in dataset: pmf.Update(data) The other adv an tage is that it pro vides a framew ork for solving man y similar problems. In the next section w e'll solv e the Mon t y Hall problem computationally and then see what parts of the framew ork are the same. The co de in this section is a v ailable from http: thinkbayes.com cookie2. py . F or more information see Section . . The Mon t y Hall problem The Mon t y Hall problem T o solv e the Mon t y Hall problem, I'll de ne a new class: class Monty(Pmf): def init (self, hypos): Pmf. init (self) for hypo in hypos: self.Set(hypo, ) self.Normalize() So far Monty and Cookie are exactly the same. And the co de that creates the Pmf is the same, to o, except for the names of the h yp otheses: hypos ' ABC ' pmf Monty(hypos) Calling Update is prett y m uc h the same: data ' B ' pmf.Update(data) And the implemen tation of Update is exactly the same: def Update(self, data): for hypo in self.Values(): like self.Likelihood(data, hypo) self.Mult(hypo, like) self.Normalize() The only part that requires some w ork is Likelihood : def Likelihood(self, data, hypo): if hypo data: return elif hypo ' A ' : return else: return Finally , prin ting the results is the same: for hypo, prob in pmf.Items(): print
