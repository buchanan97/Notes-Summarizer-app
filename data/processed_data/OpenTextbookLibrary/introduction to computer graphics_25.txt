the big change is that in modern computers, graphics processing is done by a specia lized component called a GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit. A GPU includes processors for d oing graphics computations; in fact, it can include a large number of such processors that wo rk in parallel to greatly speed up graphical operations. It also includes its own dedicated me mory for storing things like images and lists of coordinates. GPU processors have very fast acce ss to data that is stored in GPU memory much faster than their access to data stored in the co mputer s main memory. To draw a line or perform some other graphical operation, the CPU simply has to send commands, along with any necessary data, to the GPU, which is responsible for actually carrying out those commands. The CPU o oads most of the graph ical work to the GPU, which is optimized to carry out that work very quickly. The se t of commands that the GPU understands make up the API of the GPU. Open GL is an example of a graphics API, and most GPUs support Open GL in the sense that they can understan d Open GL commands, or at least that Open GL commands can e ciently be translated into commands that the GPU can understand. Open GL is not the only graphics API. In fact, it is in the proce ss of being replaced by more modern alternatives, including Vulkan an open API from the s ame group that is responsible for Open GL. There are also proprietary APIs used by Apple and Mic rosoft: Metal and Direct3 D. As for the Web, a new
