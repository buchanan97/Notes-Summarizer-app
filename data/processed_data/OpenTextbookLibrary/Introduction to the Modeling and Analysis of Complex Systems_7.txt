many of you. I also hope that this book can serve as a good introduction and reference for graduate students and researchers who are new to the eld of complex systems. In this textbook, we will use Python for computational modeling and simulation. Python is a rapidly growing computer programming language widely used for scienti c computing and also for system development in the information technology industries. It is freely available and quite easy to learn for non-computer science majors. I hope that using Python as a modeling and simulation tool will help you gain some real marketable skills, and it will thus be much more bene cial than using other pre-made modeling simulation software. All the Python sample codes for modeling examples are available from the textbook s website at http: bingweb.binghamton.edu sayama textbook , which are directly linked from each code example shown in this textbook (if you are reading this electronically). Solutions for the exercises are also available from this website. To maintain a good balance between accessibility and technical depth rigor, I have written most of the topics in two chapters, one focusing on hands-on modeling work and the other focusing on more advanced mathematical analysis. Here is a more speci c breakdown: Preliminary chapters , Modeling chapters , , , , , , , , Analysis chapters , , , , , , , The preliminary and modeling chapters are marked with an orange side bar at the top, while the analysis chapters are marked with a blue side bar at the bottom. The modeling chapters won t require any in-depth mathematical skills; some basic knowledge of derivatives and probabilities is enough. The analysis chapters
