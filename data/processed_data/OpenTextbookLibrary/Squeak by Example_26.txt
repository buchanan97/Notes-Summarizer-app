Select Collections Tests-Text and the pane to the right will show all of the test A quick tour of Squeak Figure : Accepting the test Shout method class String Test . classes in that category, which includes the class String Test .

The list of tests that gave rise to errors is shown in the bottom right pane; as you can see, String Test test Shout is the culprit. (Note that String Test test Shout is the Smalltalk way of identifying the test Shout method of the String Test class.) If you click on that line of text, the erroneous test will run again, this time in such a way that you see the error happen: Message Not Understood: Byte String shout . De ning a new method The window that opens with the error message is the Smalltalk debugger (see Figure ). We will look at the debugger and how to use it in Chapter . Figure : The (pre-)debugger. The error is, of course, exactly what we expected: running the test generates an error because we haven t yet written a method that tells strings how to shout . Nevertheless, it s good practice to make sure that the test fails because this con rms that we have
