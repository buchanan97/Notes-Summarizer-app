a variety of other courses that overlap to some greater or lesser degree with networking. At Loyola, this book has been used sometimes coupled with a second textbook in courses in computer security, network management, telecommunications, and even introduction-to-computing courses for non-majors. Another possibility is an alternative or nontraditional presentation of networking itself. It is when used in concert with other works, in particular, that this book s being free is of marked advantage. Finally, I hope the book may also be useful as a reference work. To this end, I have attempted to ensure that the indexing and cross-referencing is suf cient to support the drop-in reader. Similarly, obscure or specialized notation is kept to a minimum. Much is sometimes made, in the world of networking textbooks, about top-down versus bottom-up sequencing. This book is not really either, although the chapters are mostly numbered in bottom-up fashion. Instead, the rst chapter provides a relatively complete overview of the LAN, IP and transport network layers (along with a few other things), allowing subsequent chapters to refer to all network layers without forward German Edition An Introduction to Computer Networks, Release reference, and, more importantly, allowing the chapters to be covered in a variety of different orders. As a practical matter, when I use this text to teach Loyola s Introduction to Computer Networks course, I cover the IP routing and TCP material more or less in parallel. A distinctive feature of the book is the extensive coverage of TCP: TCP dynamics, newer versions of TCP such as TCP Cubic and BBR TCP, and chapters on using the ns- and ns- simulators and the Mininet emulator. This has its roots in
