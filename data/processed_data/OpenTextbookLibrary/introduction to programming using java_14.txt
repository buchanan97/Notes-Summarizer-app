is the program counter , or PC. The CPU uses the PC to keep track of where it is in the pro gram it is executing. The PC simply stores the memory address of th e next instruction that the CPU should execute. At the beginning of each fetch-and-exec ute cycle, the CPU checks the PC to see which instruction it should fetch. During the cours e of the fetch-and-execute cycle, the number in the PC is updated to indicate the instruction th at is to be executed in the next cycle. Usually, but not always, this is just the instruction that sequentially follows the current instruction in the program. Some machine language instruct ions modify the value that is stored in the PC. This makes it possible for the computer to jump fr om one point in the program to another point, which is essential for implementing the pr ogram features known as loops and branches that are discussed in Section . A computer executes machine language programs mechanicall y that is without understanding them or thinking about them simply because of the w ay it is physically put together. This is not an easy concept. A computer is a machine built of mi llions of tiny switches called transistors , which have the property that they can be wired together in su ch a way that an output from one switch can turn another switch on or o . As a co mputer computes, these switches turn each other on or o in a pattern determined both by the way they are wired together and by the program that the computer is executing. Machine language instructions are expressed
