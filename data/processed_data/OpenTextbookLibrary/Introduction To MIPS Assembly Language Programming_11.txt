Chapter Introduction One of the major goals of computer science is to use abstraction to insulate the users from how the computer works. For instance, computers can interpret speech and use natural language processing to allow novice users to perform some pretty amazing tasks. Even programming languages are written to en hance the ability of the person writing the code to create and support the program, and a goal of most modern languages is to be hardware agnostic. Abstraction is a very positive goal, but at some level a computer is just a machine. While High Level Languages (HLL) abstract and hide the underlying hardware, they must be translated into assembly language to use the hardware. One of the goals of a computer science education is to strip away these abstraction and make the workings of the computing machin e clear. Without an understanding of a computer as a machine, even the best programmer, system administrator,
