answer. Note that reading the answer is blocking , meaning receive Data returns when a response has been read. Then, the contents of variable data is processed. Script : Bounding the Maximum Time for Data Reception. client Socket data "create and connect the TCP client Socket" data : client Socket receive Data Timeout: "Process data" on: Connection Timed Out do: :time Out Exception self cr Log: 'No data received!'; cr Log: 'Network connection is too slow or server is down.' Note that by using receive Data , the client waits until the server either sends no more data, or closes the connection. This means that the client may wait inde nitely. An alternative is to have the client signal a Connection Timed Out exception if client had waited for too long as shown in Script . We use message receive Data Timeout: to ask the client socket to wait for seconds. If data is received during this period of time, it is processed silently. But if no data is received during the seconds, a Connection Timed Out is signaled. In the example we log a description of what happened. Close a Socket A TCP socket remains alive while devices at both ends are connected. A socket is closed by sending the message close to it. The socket remains connected until the other side closes it. This may last inde nitely when there is a network failure or when the other side is down. This is why sockets also accept the destroy message, which frees system resources required by the socket. In practice we use close And Destroy . It rst attempts to close the socket by sending the close message.
