of text typed by a programmer, it is the directing force that makes the computer do what it does, it is data in the computer s memory, and, at the same time, it controls the actions performed on this memory. Analogies that try to compare programs to familiar objects tend to fall short. A superficially fitting one is to compare a program to a machine lots of separate parts tend to be involved, and to make the whole thing tick, we have to consider the ways in which these parts interconnect and contribute to the operation of the whole. A computer is a physical machine that acts as a host for these immaterial machines. Computers themselves can do only stupidly straightforward things. The reason they are so useful is that they do these things at an incredibly high speed. A program can ingeniously combine an enormous number of these simple actions to do very complicated things. A program is a building of thought. It is costless to build, it is weightless, and it grows easily under our typing hands. But as a program grows, so does its complexity. The skill of programming is the skill of building programs that don t confuse the programmer. The best programs are those that manage to do something interesting while still being easy to understand. Some programmers believe that this complexity is best managed by using only a small set of well-understood techniques in their programs. They have composed strict rules ( best practices ) prescribing the form programs should have and carefully stay within their safe little zone. This is not only boring it is ineffective. New problems often require new solutions. The
