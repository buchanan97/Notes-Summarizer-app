not declared befor e it is used? Consider Listing . Change line to read abc ; instead of i ; Compile the program. What is the response you get from the compiler? . Java does not permit reserved words to be used as variable names. Consider Listing again . Change all references to the variable i to public , as shown here: int public; public ; System.out.println( public); Compile the program. What is the response you get from the compiler? . Java variable names are case sensitive so two variables named Message and message do not refer to the same thing. Modify line in the Hello World to be: System.out.println( Message); What is the response you get from the Java compiler? Primitive Data Types Numeric Data Types: byte , short , int, long Numeric d ata types are used for numer values where there is no fractional component - all values are whole integers. The byte , short , int, and long types differ in the amount of memory used (and therefore minimum and maximum values): data type memory minimum value maximum value byte byte - short bytes -32768 32767 int bytes -2147483648 2147483647 long bytes -9223372036854775807 9223372036854775808 Calculations can involve any of addition, subtraction, multip lication, division, and modulo. The o perations are represented by , -, , , and respectively. Some examples follow: operator example of use example s result - - Integer Arithmetic If the operands of an arithmetic operation are both integers, the result is an integer. Consider division - there is no remainder evaluates to and not . Modulo gives the remainder when the first operand is d ivided by the second operand. The result
