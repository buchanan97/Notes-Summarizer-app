Foundation, this book is free like free speech, but not necessarily free like free pizza. It came about because of a collaboration that would not have been possible without the GNU Free Documentation License. So we thank the Free Software Foundation for developing this license and, of course, making it available to us. We also thank the more than sharp-eyed and thoughtful readers who have sent us suggestions and corrections over the past few years. In the spirit of free software, we decided to express our gratitude in the form of a contributor list. Unfortunately, this list is not complete, but we are doing our best to keep it up to date. If you have a chance to look through the list, you should realize that each pers on here has spared you and all subsequent readers from the confusion of a technical error or a less-than-transparent explanation, just by sending us a note. Impossible as it may seem after so many corrections, there may still be err ors in this book. If you should stumble across one, please check the online version of the book at http: thinkpython.com , which is the most up-to-date version. If the error has not been corrected, please take a minute to send us email at feedback thinkpython.com . If we make a change due to your suggestion, you will appear in the next version of the contributor list (unless you ask to be omitt ed). Thank you! Lloyd Hugh Allen sent in a correction to Section . Yvon Boulianne sent in a correction of a semantic error in Chapter . Fred Bremmer submitted a correction in Section . Jonah Cohen wrote the Perl
