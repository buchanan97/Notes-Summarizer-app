To actually send this message, you must accept it. Accept the new class de nition. A rst application Figure : The class-creation Template. Either yellow-click and select accept , or use the shortcut CMD s(for save ). The message will be sent to Simple Switch Morph , which will cause the new class to be compiled. Once the class de nition is accepted, the class will be created and appear in the classes pane of the browser (Figure ). The editing pane now shows the class de nition, and a small pane below it will remind you to write a few words describing the purpose of the class. This is called a class comment , and it is quite important to write one that will give other programmers a highlevel overview of the purpose of
