apply them to various subjects of your own interest. Exercise Choose a few concepts of your own interest from Fig. . Do a quick online literature search for those words, using Google Scholar ( http: scholar.google.com ), ar Xiv ( http: arxiv.org ), etc., to nd out more about their meaning, when and how frequently they are used in the literature, and in what context. Exercise Conduct an online search to nd visual examples or illustrations of some of the concepts shown in Fig. . Discuss which example(s) and or illustration(s) are most effective in conveying the key idea of each concept. Then create a short presentation of complex systems science using the visual materials you selected. Exercise Think of other ways to organize the concepts shown in Fig. (and any other relevant concepts you want to include). Then create your own version of a map of complex systems science. Now we are ready to move on. Let s begin our journey of complex systems modeling and analysis. Chapter Fundamentals of Modeling Models in Science and Engineering Science is an endeavor to try to understand the world around us by discovering fundamental laws that describe how it works. Such laws include Newton s law of motion, the ideal gas law, Ohm s law in electrical circuits, the conservation law of energy, and so on, some of which you may have learned already. A typical cycle of scienti c effort by which scientists discover these fundamental laws may look something like this: . Observe nature. . Develop a hypothesis that could explain your observations. . From your hypothesis, make some predictions that are testable through an experiment. . Carry out the
