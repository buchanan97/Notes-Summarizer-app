think creatively abo ut solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problemsolving skills. That s why this chapter is called, The way of the program. On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On anot her level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer. The Python programming language The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an exampl e of ahigh-level language ; other high-level languages you might have heard of are C, C , Perl, and Java. As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also lowlevel languages , sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly The way of the program languages. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages. Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. But the advantages are enormous. First, it is much easier to program in a hig hlevel language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to w rite, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are portable , meaning that they can run on di erent kinds of computers with few or no modi cations. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another. Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written
