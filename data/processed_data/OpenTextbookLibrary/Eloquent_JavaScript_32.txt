can be used within larger expressions. In the following code, a call to Math.min , which is the opposite of Math.max , is used as part of a plus expression: console.log(Math.min( , ) ); Chapter will explain how to write your own functions. Controlflow When your program contains more than one statement, the statements are executed as though they were a story, from top to bottom. For example, the following program has two statements. The first asks the user for a number, and the second, which is executed after the first, shows the square of that number: let the Number Number(prompt("Pick a number")); console.log("Your number is the square root of " the Number the Number); The function Numberconverts a value to a number. We need that conversion because the result of promptis a string value, and we want a number. There are similar functions called Stringand Boolean that convert values to those types. Here is the rather trivial schematic representation of straight-line control flow: Conditionalexecution Not all programs are straight roads. We may, for example, want to create a branching road where the program takes the proper branch based on the situation at hand. This is called conditional execution . Conditional execution is created with the ifkeyword in Java Script. In the simplecase,wewantsomecodetobeexecutedif,andonlyif,acertaincondition holds. We might, for example, want to show the square of the input only if the input is actually a number: let the Number Number(prompt("Pick a number")); if (!Number.is Na N(the Number)) console.log("Your number is the square root of " the Number the Number); With this modification, if you enter parrot , no output is shown. The ifkeyword executes or skips a statement depending on the value
