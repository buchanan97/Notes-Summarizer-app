what constitutes valid values. You should develop code to check for improper values and, if that is the case, terminate execution in a planned way instead of an unplanned way. Example . Throwing an illegal argument exception get Age requires the value of yyyymmdd to be a string that has digits, a dash, digits ( to ), a dash, followed by more digits ( to , depending on the month). We will base our validation on some character processing techniques we are aware of. We consider the following rules for a valid yyyymmdd value: yyyy, mm, dd are separated by a single dash yyyymmdd is a string of length yyyy can be any digits mm can be any digits (really these should be in the range ) dd can be any digits (really these should be appropriate for the month) we ignore leap years Some sample values that are invalid according to the above are: "1990- - " is not characters long "abcd- - " has non-numeric digits "2010 " has as a separator instead of a dash We have seen before that certain errors result in exceptions that cause a CHAPTER . VALIDATION AND TEXT MANIPULATION program to terminate abruptly. For instance, if an array subscript is out of bounds the program is terminated with an Array Out Of Bounds Exception exception. The get Age method in the program below introduces the Java exception Illegal Argument Exception ; this exception is thrown if the argument passed in does not pass the checks performed. If this exception is thrown then a program terminates immediately. Listing : Throwing an exception 1import java . util . Scanner ; 2import java . time
