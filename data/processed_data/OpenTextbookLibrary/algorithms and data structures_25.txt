analysis, where a scientist may not know a priori what she is looking for, and the only way to look at a mass of data is to generate pictures from it (see a special issue on scientific visualization Nie ). At times static pictures will do, but in simulations ( e.g. of the onset of turbulent flow) we prefer to see an animation over time. Turning to the techniques of animation , computer technology is in the midst of extremely rapid evolution toward ever-higher-quality interactive image generation on powerful graphics workstations (see RN for a survey of the state of the art). Fortunately, animating algorithms such as those presented in this book can be done adequately with the graphics tools available on low-cost workstations. These algorithms operate on discrete data configurations (such as matrices, trees, graphs), and use standard data structures, such as arrays and lists. For such limited classes of algorithms, there are software packages that help produce animations based on specifications, with a minimum of extra programming required. An example of an algorithm animation environment is the BALSA system Bro , BS . A more recent example is the XYZ Geo Bench, which animates geometric algorithms NSDAB . In our experience, the bottleneck of algorithm animation is not the extra code required, but graphic design. What do you want to show, and how do you display it, keeping in mind the limitations of the system you have to work with? The key point to consider is that data does not look like anything until we have defined a mapping from the data space into visual space. Defining such a mapping ranges from trivial to practically impossible. .For some
