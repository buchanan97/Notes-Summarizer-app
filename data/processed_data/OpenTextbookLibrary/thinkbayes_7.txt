some st yle guides and deprecated in others. I don't ha v e a strong preference. I had to c ho ose one, and this is the one I c hose. And nally one t yp ographical note: throughout the b o ok, I use PMF and CDF for the mathematical concept of a probabilit y mass function or cum ulativ e distribution function, and Pmf and Cdf to refer to the Python ob jects I use to represen t them. Prerequisites There are sev eral excellen t mo dules for doing Ba y esian statistics in Python, including pymc and Op en BUGS. I c hose not to use them for this b o ok b ecause . Prerequisites ix y ou need a fair amoun t of bac kground kno wledge to get started with these mo dules, and I w an t to k eep the prerequisites minimal. If y ou kno w Python and a little bit ab out probabilit y , y ou are ready to start this b o ok. Chapter is ab out probabilit y and Ba y es's theorem; it has no co de. Chapter in tro duces Pmf , a thinly disguised Python dictionary I use to represen t a probabilit y mass function (PMF). Then Chapter in tro duces Suite , a kind of Pmf that pro vides a framew ork for doing Ba y esian up dates. In some of the later c hapters, I use analytic distributions including the Gaussian (normal) distribution, the exp onen tial and P oisson distributions, and the b eta distribution. In Chapter I break out the less-common Diric hlet distribution, but I explain
