stored. To use the terminology of Chapter , memory is where theenvironmentlives. It isinvisibleto the programmer, but it is alsovery much there.The single most important trick to learning how to write correct code is being able to summon to mind what memory looks like at any point in time. The code you must write is a natural consequence of that. CHAPTER . MEMORY PICTURES A picture of memory It s easier with pictures at first, so we ll draw plenty of them. Our memory pictureswill have a very specific format, and this is crucially important: don t get creative with how things are labeled or where things are drawn. In order for your code to workyou must have this picture exactly right.It s not art; it s science. Ourmemorypictureswillalwaysbedividedintoexactlytwo realms, one on the left and one on the right, labeled as follows: The left column s name should be recognizable, since that s exactly what we covered last chapter. The right column won t have anything in it for a couple chapters. Writing to memory When we create atomic variables in a Code cell, a la: pin count username 'Bekka Palmer' each one gets put on the left-hand side of the diagram as anamed box. The name of the box is the variable s name, and the thing inside of the box is its value. . A PICTURE OF MEMORY27 It doesn t matter which boxes are higher or lower on the page, only that the names stick with their boxes and don t get mixed up. As a bonus, I have colored the boxes differently, indicating that pin count(anint) is a different type thanusername(astr). Creating more variables just adds
