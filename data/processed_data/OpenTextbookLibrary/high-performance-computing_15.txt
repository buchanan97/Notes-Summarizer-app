a price, but vendors punted by selling computers with wait states added to the memory access cycle. W ait states are artificial delays that slow down references so that memory appears to match the speed of a faster CPU at a penalty . However , the technique of adding wait states begins to significantly impact performance around ? MHz. T oday , CPU speeds are even farther ahead of DRAM speeds. The clock time for commodity home computers has gone from ns for the XT to around ns for a -MHz Pentium-II, but the access time for commodity DRAM has decreased disproportionately less from ns to around ns. Processor performance doubles every months, while memory performance doubles roughly every seven years. The CPU memory speed gap is even lar ger in workstations. Some models clock at intervals as short as ns. How do vendors make up the dif ference between CPU speeds and memory speeds? The memory in the Cray- supercomputer used SRAM that was capable of keeping up with the -ns clock cycle. Using SRAM for its main memory system was one of the reasons that most Cray systems needed liquid cooling. Unfortunately , it s not practical for a moderately priced system to rely exclusively on SRAM for storage. It s also not practical to manufacture inexpensive systems with enough storage using exclusively SRAM. The solution is a hierarchy of memories using processor registers, one to three levels of SRAM cache, DRAM main memory , and virtual memory stored on media such as disk. At each point in the memory hierarchy , tricks are employed to make the best use of the available technology . For the remainder
