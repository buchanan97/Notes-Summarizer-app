the network (the cities, computers, cell phones, or whatever is being connected) together with lines to represent the connections between those nodes (the roads, wires, wireless connections, etc.). This model is called a graph. It is important to be aware that only at a node may information, tra ic, etc. pass from one edge of a graph to another edge. If we want to model a highway network using a graph, and two highways intersect in the middle of nowhere, we must still place a node at that intersection. If we draw a graph in which edges cross over each other but there is no node at that point, you should think of it as if there is an overpass there with no exits from one highway to the other: the roads happen to cross, but they are not connecting in any meaningful sense. EXAMPLE . The following diagram: Fort Macleod Lethbridge Medicine Hat Calgary Strathmore is a graph. Many questions that have important real-world applications can be modeled with graphs. These are not always limited to questions that seem to apply to networks. Some questions can be modeled as graphs by using lines to represent constraints or some other relationship between them (e.g. the nodes might represent classes, with a line between them if they cannot . What is Combinatorics? be scheduled at the same time, or some nodes might represent students and others classes, with a line between a student and each of the classes they are taking). After studying graph theory in this course, you should be able to solve problems such as: How can we find a good route for garbage trucks to take through a
