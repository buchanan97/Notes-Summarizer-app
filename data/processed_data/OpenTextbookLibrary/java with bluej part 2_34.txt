CHAPTER . VALIDATION AND TEXT MANIPULATION Example . Checking for a palindrome. You may have noted the reverse method of String Builder . If you have not programmed reversing a string, you should - that is a good exercise in programming. However, now that you know there is a method to perform the reversing of a string we expect you would, if needed, use reverse in the future. Consider the following program that gets a string from the user and determines if it is a palindrome. Listing : Check for a palindrome with String Builder. 1import java . util . Scanner ; 2public class Reverse String public static void main ( String args ) Scanner kb new Scanner ( System .in); System . out . println (" Enter a string "); two instances of String Builder String Builder original new String Builder (kb. next ()); String Builder reversed new String Builder ( original ); reverse one of these reversed . reverse (); System . out . println (" original :"
