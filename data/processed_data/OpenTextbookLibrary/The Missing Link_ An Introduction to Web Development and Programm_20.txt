robot and network, is an accurate description of what it entails. Botnets are programs that use a network connection to communicate with each other to coordinate and perform tasks. Originally, botnets were created as part of programs for Internet Relay Chat ( IRC) to help establish and control channels people would log into to talk to each other. They are still in frequent use today for a number of legitimate, non-malicious tasks. We have also seen a rise in malicious botnets, designed to work undetected in the background of your computer. The controller (typically referred to as the command and control server) uses the infected machines to complete tasks that require large amounts of processing power and or bandwidth to complete, like finding or exploiting weaknesses in networks or websites, or to mine infected systems for personal data such as credentials, credit card numbers, and other information that can then be used or sold to others. ADDITIONAL NOTES It did not take long for the first virus to enter the internet. Just two years after the first systems were connected, The Creeper (a self-replicating script) was created in 1971, which did no harm but displayed I m the creeper, catch me if you can on infected machines. It was immediately followed by The Reaper, the first anti-virus program, which too self-replicated, removing the Creeper wherever it was found. Some botnet controllers have grown so large and organized that they act as businesses in competition, typically renting their botnet out as a service or tool to others for agreed upon rates. Efforts by security researchers to detect and analyze botnets often involve close coordination with government agencies and law enforcement as
