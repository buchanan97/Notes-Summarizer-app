that the information is delivered to onereceiver that belongs to this set. Usually, the receiver closest to the source is the one that receives the information sent by this particular source. The anycast transmission mode is useful to ensure redundancy, as when one of the receivers fails, the network will ensure that information will be delivered to another receiver belonging to the same group. However, in practice supporting the anycast transmission mode can be dif cult. A S B Figure : Anycast transmission In the example above, the three hosts marked with are part of the same anycast group. When host Ssends information to this anycast group, the network ensures that it will reach one of the members of the anycast group. The dashed lines show a possible delivery via nodes ,2and4. A subsequent anycast transmission from host Sto the same anycast group could reach the host attached to intermediate node 3as shown by the plain line. An anycast transmission reaches a member of the anycast group that is chosen by the network in function of the current network conditions. Services and protocols An important aspect to understand before studying computer networks is the difference between a service and a protocol. In order to understand the difference between the two, it is useful to start with real world examples. The traditional Post provides a service where a postman delivers letters to recipients. The Post de nes precisely which types of letters (size, weight, etc) can be delivered by using the Standard Mail service. Furthermore, the format of the envelope is speci ed (position of the sender and recipient addresses, position of the stamp). Someone who wants to send a letter
