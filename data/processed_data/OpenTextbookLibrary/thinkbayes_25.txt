Dividing through yields p(Aj D) andp(Cj D) . So y ou are b etter o switc hing. There are man y v ariations of the Mon t y Hall problem. One of the strengths of the Ba y esian approac h is that it generalizes to handle these v ariations. F or example, supp ose that Mon t y alw a ys c ho oses B if he can, and only c ho oses C if he has to (b ecause the car is b ehind B). In that case the revised table is: Prior Lik eliho o d P osterior p(H)p(Dj H)p(H) p(Dj H)p(Hj D) A B C The only c hange is p(Dj A) . If the car is b ehind A , Mon t y can c ho ose to op en B or C. But in this v ariation he alw a ys c ho oses B, so p(Dj A) . As a result, the lik eliho o ds are the same for A and C , and the p osteriors are the same: p(Aj D) p(Cj D) . In this case, the fact that Mon t y c hose Chapter . Ba y es's Theorem B rev eals no information ab out the lo cation of the car, so it do esn't matter whether the con testan t stic ks or switc hes. On the other hand, if he had op ened C , w e w
