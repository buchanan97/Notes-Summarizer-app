The second part (Chapters through ) focuses on the remaining language elements, including data types and operators (Chapter ), control structures (Chapter ), strings (Chapter ), and arrays (Chapter ). It also provides thorough coverage of inheritance and polymorphism, the primary mechanisms of object orientation: (Chapter ). Part three (Chapters through ) covers a variety of advanced topics (Table ). Topics from these chapters can be used selectively depending on instructor and student interest. Throughout the book, key concepts are introduced through simple, easy-to-grasp examples. Many of the concepts are used to create a set of games, which are used as a running example throughout the text. Our pedagogical approach focuses on design. Rather than starting of with language details, programming examples are carefully developed with an emphasis on the principles of object-oriented design. Table2 provides an example syllabus from our one-semester CS1 course. Our semester is weeks (plus one reading week during which classes do not meet). We pick and choose from among the advanced topics during the last two weeks of the course, depending on the interests and skill levels of the students.
