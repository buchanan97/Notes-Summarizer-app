Visual test for randomness Our visual system is amazingly powerful at detecting patterns of certain kinds in the midst of noise. Random number generators (RNGs) are intended to simulate "noise" by means of simple formulas. When patterns appear in the visual representation of supposedly random numbers, chances are that this RNG will also fail more rigorous statistical tests. The eyes' pattern detection ability serves well to disqualify a faulty RNG but cannot certify one as adequate. Exhibit shows a simulation of the Galton board. In theory, the resulting density diagram should approximate a bellshaped Gaussian distribution. Obviously, the RNG used falls short of expectations. Exhibit : One look suffices to unmask a bad RNG. Numerics of chaos, or chaos of numerical computation? The following example shows the effect of rounding errors and precision in linear recurrence relations. The dstep linear recurrence with constant coefficients in the domain of real or complex numbers, Algorithms and Data Structures A Global Text . Algorithm animation is one of the most frequent formulas evaluated in scientific and technical computation (e.g. for the solution of differential equations). By proper choice of the constants c i and of initial values z , z1, , zd we can generate sequences zk that when plotted in the plane of complex numbers form many different figures. With d and , for example, we generate circles. The pictures in Exhibit were all generated with d and conditions that determine a curve that is most easily described as a circle running around the
