latter judgement depends also on what the D.L. has learned, supplementary rules, dictionaries, etc. The resulting translations are reasonable, but not perfect. (They can be improved by further editing by human readers or translators.) You can see where some of the problems may lie. Context is one. Single words might be homographs (for example, bank (financial institution) and bank (side of a river)) and the translation system might lack the context to disambiguate them. Plain lack of understanding may be another. Human translators presumably will understand their translation, and this would prevent certain kinds of ridiculousness. In a general way, a neural DL will learn what is silly and what is not. But still, in no sense does it understand the text, and this leaves open to making certain kinds of mistakes (i.e. those where the words, grammar, and construction are all fine but the result is nonsense). Douglas Hofstadter offers interesting examples, including: In their house, everything comes in pairs. There s his car and her car, his towels and her towels, and his library and hers. (Hofstadter 2018) As of 2023, machine translation simply cannot translate this correctly, say from English to French. An anecdote. The author's wife had some dental treatment while living in Japan. The Japanese hygienist had a little device that she spoke into in Japanese, and it spoke back in English. So, this is digitization and transcription of speech, translation of one language to another, then speaking aloud the resulting translation. Here is a real example of what it said to her: Pardon me, may I please put red dye on your dirty teeth! Despite the occasional oddity, machine translation can work hours a
