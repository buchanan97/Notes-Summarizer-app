more or less like these. Thus, we can describe programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks ar e simple enough to be performed with one of these basic instructions. That may be a little vague, but we will come back to this topic later when we ta lk aboutalgorithms . What is debugging? Programming is a complex process, and because it is done by human beings, it often leads to errors. For whimsical reasons, programming errors are call edbugs and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called debugging . Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and semantic errors. It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly. Syntax errors Python can only execute a program if the program is syntactically correct; otherwise, the process fails and returns an error message. Syntax refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example, in English, a sentence must begin with a capital letter and end with a period. this sentence contains a syntax error . So does this one For most readers, a few syntax errors are not a signi cant problem, which is w hy we can read the poetry of e. e. cummings without spewing error messages. Python is not so forgiving. If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your pro gram, Python will print an error message and quit, and you will not be able to run your program. During the rst few weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot
