in Section . Solutions to these exercises are in chap01soln.ipynb . Exercise If you have Jupyter, load chap01.ipynb , read through it, and run the examples. You can also view this notebook at http: tinyurl.com thinkdsp01 . Exercise Go tohttp: freesound.org and download a sound sample that includes music, speech, or other sounds that have a well-de ned pitch. Select a roughly half-second segment where the pitch is constant. Compute and plot the spectrum of the segment you selected. What connection can you make between the timbre of the sound and the harmonic structure you see in the spectrum? Usehigh pass ,low pass , andband stop to lter out some of the harmonics. Then convert the spectrum back to a wave and listen to it. How does the sound relate to the changes you made in the spectrum? Exercise Synthesize a compound signal by creating Sin Signal and Cos Signal objects and adding them up. Evaluate the signal to get a Wave, and listen to it. Compute its Spectrum and plot it. What happens if you add frequency components that are not multiples of the fundamental? Exercise Write a function called stretch that takes a Wave and a stretch factor and speeds up or slows down the wave by modifying tsandframerate . Hint: it should only take two lines of code. Chapter . Sounds and signals Chapter Harmonics In this chapter I present several new waveforms; we will look at their spectrums to understand their harmonic structure , which is the set of sinusoids they are made up of. I'll also introduce one of the most important phenomena in digital signal processing: aliasing. And I'll explain a little more about
