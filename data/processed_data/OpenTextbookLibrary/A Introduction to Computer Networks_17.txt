networks that provide the connection between machines within, say, a home, school or corporation. LANs are, as the name says, local ; it is the IP, or Internet Protocol, layer that provides an abstraction for connecting multiple LANs into, well, the Internet. Finally, TCP deals with transport and connections and actually sending user data. This chapter also contains some important other material. The section on datagram forwarding , central to packet-based switching and routing, is essential. This chapter also discusses packets generally, congestion, and sliding windows, but those topics are revisited in later chapters. Firewalls and network address translation are also covered here and not elsewhere. Layers These three topics LANs, IP and TCP are often called layers ; they constitute the Link layer, the Internetwork layer, and the Transport layer respectively. Together with the Application layer (the software you use), these form the four-layer model for networks. A layer, in this context, corresponds strongly to the idea of a programming interface or library, with the understanding that a given layer communicates directly only with the two layers immediately above and below it. An application hands off a chunk of data to the TCP library, which in turn makes calls to the IP library, which in turn calls the LAN layer for actual delivery. An application does notinteract directly with the IP and LAN layers at all. The LAN layer is in charge of actual delivery of packets, using LAN-layer-supplied addresses. It is often conceptually subdivided into the physical layer dealing with, eg, the analog electrical, optical or radio signaling mechanisms involved, and above that an abstracted logical LAN layer that describes all the digital that is, non-analog operations on
