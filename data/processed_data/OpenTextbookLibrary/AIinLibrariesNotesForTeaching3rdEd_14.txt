prompted by the needs of ML, rather it was aiming for a Universal Library. As James Somers writes: You were going to get one-click access to the full text of nearly every book that s ever been published. Books still in print you d have to pay for, but everything else a collection slated to grow larger than the holdings at the Library of Congress, Harvard, the University of Michigan, at any of the great national libraries of Europe would have been available for free at terminals that were going to be placed in every local library that wanted one. At the terminal you were going to be able to search tens of millions of books and read every page of any book you found. You d be able to highlight passages and make annotations and share them; for the first time, you d be able to pinpoint an idea somewhere inside the vastness of the printed record, and send somebody straight to it with a link. Books would become as instantly available, searchable, copy-pasteable as alive in the digital world as web pages. (Somers 2017) There is another huge potential benefit that arises from the network effects of having many books digitized collectively. The Google Page Rank algorithm, which the core of its very successful search engine for the web, uses links between web pages to establish ranking. Something similar, citation indexing, citation counting, and citation ranking, had long been in use in bibliometrics and informetrics working with paper based libraries (Dizikes 2011; Ara jo, Castanha, and Hj rland 2021). If books, journals, and other paper-based resources were also to be available digitally, powerful algorithms using linking then could
