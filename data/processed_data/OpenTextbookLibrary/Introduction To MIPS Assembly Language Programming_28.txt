less positive numbers than negative numbers. So while is , the 's complement value of an -bit number runs from - . Finally, as stated in the previous section, just like zeros can be added to the left of a positive number without effecting its value, in 's complement ones can be added to the left of a negative number without effecting its value. For example: 0010 0000 0010 1110 1111 1110 - Adding leading zeros to a positive number, and leading ones to a negative number, is called sign extension of a 's complement number. Chapter . Integer Arithmetic Chapter . Integer Addition Binary whole number addit ion was covered in chapter . Integer addition is similar to binary whole number addition except that both positive and negative numbers must be considered. For example, consider adding the two positive numbers 0010 ( ) 0011 ( ) 0101 ( ). Figure - : Addition of two positive integers Addition of mixed positive and negative numbers, and two negative numbers also works in the same manner, as the following two examples show. The first adds 0010 ( ) 1101 (- ) 1111 (- ), and the second adds 1110 (- ) 1101 (- ) 1011 (- ). INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING Figure - : Addition of positive and negative integers Figure - : Addition of two negative integers Because integers have fixed sizes, addition and subtraction can cause a problem known as integer overflow . This happens which the two numbers which are being added are large positive or negative values, and the combining of the values results in numbers too big to be store in the integer.
