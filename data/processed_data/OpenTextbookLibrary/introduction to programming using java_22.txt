one thread to another, whether the thread that is currently running likes it or not. All modern desktop and laptop computers, and even typ ical smartphones and tablets, use preemptive multitasking. Ordinary users, and indeed ordinary programmers, have no ne ed to deal with interrupts and interrupt handlers. They can concentrate on the di erent ta sks that they want the computer to perform; the details of how the computer manages to get all th ose tasks done are not important to them. In fact, most users, and many programmers, can ignor e threads and multitasking altogether. However, threads have become increasingly imp ortant as computers have become more powerful and as they have begun to make more use of multit asking and multiprocessing. In fact, the ability to work with threads is fast becoming an e ssential job skill for programmers. Fortunately, Java has good support for threads, which are bu ilt into the Java programming language as a fundamental programming concept. Programmin g with threads will be covered in Chapter . Just as important in Java and in modern programming in genera l is the basic concept of asynchronous events. While programmers don t actually dea l with interrupts directly, they do often nd themselves writing event handlers , which, like interrupt handlers, are called asynchronously when speci c events occur. Such event-dri ven programming has a very di erent feel from the more traditional straight-through, synchronous programming. We will begin with the more traditional type of programming, which i s still used for programming individual tasks, but we will return to threads and events la ter in the text, starting in Chapter By the way, the software
