ticks exactly5every microsecond, it will also deliver Mbps to its user. However, if the receiver s clock is slightly faster (resp. slower), than it will deliver slightly more (resp. less) than one million bits every second. This explains why the physical layer may lose or create bits. Note: Bit rate In computer networks, the bit rate of the physical layer is always expressed in bits per second. One Mbps is one million bits per second and one Gbps is one billion bits per second. This is in contrast with memory speci cations that are usually expressed in bytes ( bits), Kilo Bytes ( 1024 bytes) or Mega Bytes (1048576 bytes). Thus transferring one MByte through a Mbps link lasts seconds. Having perfectly synchronised clocks running at a high frequency is very dif cult in practice. However, some physical layers introduce a feedback loop that allows the receiver s clock to synchronise itself automatically to the sender s clock. However, not all physical layers include this kind of synchronisation. .

Being able to exchange bits is important as virtually any information can be encoded as a sequence of bits. Electrical engineers are used to processing streams of bits, but computer scientists usually prefer to deal with higher level concepts. A similar issue arises with le storage. Storage
