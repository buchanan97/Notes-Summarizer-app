each other with only a few or no degrees of freedom left within the system, so one can describe the collection as a single entity with a small number of variables. There are very well-developed theories and tools available to handle either case. Unfortunately, however, most real-world systems are somewhere in between. Complex systems science is a rapidly growing scienti c research area that lls the huge gap between the two traditional views that consider systems made of either completely independent or completely coupled components. This is the gap where what Weaver called problems of organized complexity exist . Complex systems science develops conceptual, mathematical, and computational tools to describe systems made ofinterdependent components. It studies the structural and dynamical properties of various systems to obtain general, cross-disciplinary implications and applications. Complex systems science has multiple historical roots and topical clusters of concepts, as illustrated in Fig. . There are two core concepts that go across almost all subareas of complex systems: emergence and self-organization. The idea of emergence was originally discussed in philosophy more than a century ago. There are many natural phenomena where some property of a system observed at macroscopic scales simply can t be reduced to microscopic physical rules that drive the system s behavior. For example, you can easily tell that a dog wagging its tail is alive, but it is extremely dif cult to explain what kind of microscopic physical chemical processes going on in its body are making this organism alive. Another typical example is your consciousness. Y ou know you are conscious, but it is hard to describe what kind of neurophysiological processes make you a conscious entity. Those macroscopic properties (livingness,
