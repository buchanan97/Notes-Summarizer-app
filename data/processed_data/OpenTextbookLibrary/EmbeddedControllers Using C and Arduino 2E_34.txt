function. For example, consider the two function fragments below: void func1( void ) int x; int y; some code here void func2( void ) int y; int z; some other code here There is no direct way to access the z variable of func2() from func1(). Likewise, there is no direct way to access the x variable of func1() from func2(). More interestingly, the y variables of func1() and func2() are entirely different! They do not refer to the same variable. This sometimes can be confusing for new programmers but it is essential for large programs. Imagine that you were working with a team of people on a very large program, perhaps tens of thousands of lines long. If the idea of local scope did not exist, you d have to make sure that every single variable in the program had a unique name! This would create a nightmare of confusion. By using local scope, you re saying: I only need this variable for a job within this function. As it only needs to exist within this function, its name is only meaningful within this function. If some form of universally known data item is needed, we can resort to the global. Globals act pretty much like statics and are usually stored the same way. If you have a program that consists of a single file, you can declare your globals by listing them at the beginning of the program before (and outside of) any functions. In this way they will be read by the compiler first and will therefore be known to all functions that follow. Do not get in the habit of declaring all variables as global. This
