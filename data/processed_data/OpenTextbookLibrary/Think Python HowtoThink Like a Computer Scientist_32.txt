and compose them. For example, the argument of a function can be any kind of expression, including arithmetic operators: x math.sin(degrees math.pi) And even function calls: x math.exp(math.log(x )) Almost anywhere you can put a value, you can put an arbitrary expression, with one exception: the left side of an assignment statement has to be a variable name. Any other expression on the left side is a syntax error (we will see exceptions to this rule later). minutes hours right hours minutes wrong! Syntax Error: can 't assign to operator Adding new functions So far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python, but it is also possible to add new functions. A function de nition speci es the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that run when the function is called. Here is an example: def print lyrics(): print("I 'm a lumberjack, and I 'm okay.") print("I sleep all night and I work all day.") defis a keyword that indicates that this is a function de nition. The name of the function isprint lyrics . The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and underscore are legal, but the rst character can t be a number. You can t use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same name. The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn t take any arguments. The rst line of the function de nition is called the header ; the rest is called the body . The header has to end with a colon and
