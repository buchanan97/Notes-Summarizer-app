stack shrinks. If we make many, many function calls with many, many declared variables, it is possible for the stack to overrun the code and data sections of our program. The system is now corrupt, and proper execution and functioning of the program are unlikely. address area used by code and data area currently unused stack area, grows toward address address , Figure , basic memory layout Above is a memory map example of a system with 64k bytes of memory (k 1024 or ). Individual memory slots are not shown. Only the general areas are shown. It is worthwhile to note that in some systems, code and data are in a common area as shown (V on Neumann architecture) while in others they are physically split (Harvard architecture). Whether split or not, the basic concepts remain. So, why would we want to split the two areas, each accessed via its own memory bus1? Simple, separating the code and data allows the processor to fetch the next instruction (code) using a memory bus that is physically separate from the data bus it is currently accessing. A shared code data memory bus would require special timing to coordinate this process as only one thing can be on the bus at any given time. Having two separate memory buses will speed execution times. A bus typically refers to a collection of wires or connections upon which multiple data bits (or address bits) are sent as a group.

Unlike BASIC or Python,
