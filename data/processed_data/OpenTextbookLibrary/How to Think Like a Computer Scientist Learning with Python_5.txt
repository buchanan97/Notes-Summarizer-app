well as on the Windows and Macintosh platforms most students have at home. I wanted it t o be free and available electronically, so that students could use it at home regar dless of their income. I wanted a language that was used by professional programmers, and one that had an active developer community around it. It had to support both procedural and object-oriented programming. And most importantly, it had to be easy to learn and teach. When I investigated the choices with these goals in mind, Python stood out as the best candidate for the job. I asked one of Yorktown s talented students, Matt Ahrens, to give Python a t ry. In two months he not only learned the language but wrote an application called py Ticket that enabled our sta to report technology problems via the Web. I knew that Matt could not have nished an application of that scale in so short a time in C , and this accomplishment, combined with Matt s positive assessment of Python, suggested that Python was the solution I was looking for. Finding a textbook Having decided to use Python in both of my introductory computer science classes the following year, the most pressing problem was the lack of an available t extbook. Free content came to the rescue. Earlier in the year, Richard Stallman had introduced me to Allen Downey. Both of us had written to Richard expressing an interest in developing free educational content. Allen had already written a rstyear computer science textbook, How to Think Like a Computer Scientist . When I read this book, I knew immediately that I wanted to use it in my class.
