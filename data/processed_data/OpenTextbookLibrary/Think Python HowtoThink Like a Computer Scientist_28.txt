errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the rst few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one. Semantic error: The third type of error is semantic , which means related to meaning. If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run without generating error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Speci cally, it will do what you told it to do. Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to gure out what it is doing. Chapter . Variables, expressions and statements Glossary variable: A name that refers to a value. assignment: A statement that assigns a value to a variable. state diagram: A graphical representation of a set of variables and the values they refer to. keyword: A reserved word that is used to parse a program; you cannot use keywords like if,def, and while as variable names. operand: One of the values on which an operator operates. expression: A combination of variables, operators, and values that represents a single result. evaluate: To simplify an expression by performing the operations in order to yield a single value. statement: A section of code that represents a command or action. So far, the statements we have seen are assignments and print statements. execute: To run a statement and do what it says. interactive mode: A way of using the Python interpreter by typing code at the prompt. script mode: A way of using the Python interpreter to read code from a script and run it. script: A
