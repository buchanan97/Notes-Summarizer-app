supported, allowing source code to be used for several different platforms by just recompiling for the new target. Its popularity means that several third-party add-ons (libraries and modules) are available to stretch the language. It has type checking which helps catch errors. It is very powerful, allowing you to get close to the metal . Generally, it creates very efficient code (small space and fast execution). What s the difference between C and C ? C is a superset of C. First came C, then came C . In fact, the name C is a programmer s joke because is the increment operator in C. Thus, C literally means increment C , or perhaps give me the next C . C does everything C does plus a whole lot more. These extra features don t come free and embedded applications usually cannot afford the overhead. Consequently, although much Embedded Controllers desktop work is done in C as well as C, most embedded work is done in C. Desktop development systems are usually referred to as C C systems meaning that they ll do both. Embedded development systems may be strictly C or even a variant of it (as is ours). Where can I buy an Arduino development board? The Arduino Uno board is available from a variety of sources including Digi-Key, Mouser, Parts Express and others. Shop around! What s the difference between desktop PC development and embedded programming? Desktop development focuses on applications for desktop computers. These include things like word processors, graphing utilities, games, CAD programs, etc. These are the things most people think of when they hear the word computer . Embedded programming focuses on the myriad
