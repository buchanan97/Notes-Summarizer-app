subtraction, there is the -operator. Division can be done with the operator. When operators appear together without parentheses, the order in which they are applied is determined by the precedence of the operators. The example shows that multiplication comes before addition. The operator has the same precedence as . Likewise, and -have the same precedence. When multiple operators with the same precedence appear next to each other, as in - , they are applied left to right: ( - ) . Don t worry too much about these precedence rules. When in doubt, just add parentheses. There is one more arithmetic operator, which you might not immediately recognize. The symbol is used to represent the remainder operation. X Y is the remainder of dividing Xby Y. For example, produces , and gives . The remainder operator s precedence is the same as that of multiplication and division. You ll also often see this operator referred to as modulo. Specialnumbers There are three special values in Java Script that are considered numbers but don t behave like normal numbers. The first two are Infinity and -Infinity , which represent the positive and negative infinities. Infinity - is still Infinity , and so on. Don t put too much trust in infinity-based computation, though. It isn t mathematically sound, and it will quickly lead to the next special number: Na N. Na Nstands for not a number , even though it isa value of the number type.

Strings The next basic data type is the string. Strings are used to represent text. They are written
