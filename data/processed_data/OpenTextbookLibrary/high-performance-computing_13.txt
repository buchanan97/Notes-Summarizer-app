of a storage medium that is not random is magnetic tape. The terms dynamic and static have to do with the technology used in the design of the memory cells. DRAMs are char ge-based devices, where each bit is represented by an electrical char ge stored in a very small capacitor . The char ge can leak away in a short amount of time, so the system has to be continually refreshed to prevent data from being lost. The act of reading a bit in DRAM also dischar ges the bit, requiring that it be refreshed. It s not possible to read the memory bit in the DRAM while it s being refreshed. Magnetic core memory is still used in applications where radiation hardness resistance to changes caused by ionizing radiation is important. SRAM is based on gates, and each bit is stored in four to six connected transistors. SRAM memories retain their data as long as they have power , without the need for any form of data refresh. DRAM of fers the best price performance, as well as highest density of memory cells per chip. This means lower cost, less board space, less power , and less heat. On the other hand, some applications such as cache and video memory require higher speed, to which SRAM is better suited. Currently , you can choose between SRAM and DRAM at slower speeds down to about nanoseconds (ns). SRAM has access times down to about ns at higher cost, heat, power , and board space. In addition to the basic technology to store a single bit of data, memory performance is limited by the practical considerations of the on-chip wiring
