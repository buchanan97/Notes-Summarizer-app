Other high-level languages you may have heard of include Python, C and C , PHP, Ruby, and Java Script. Before they can run, programs in high-level languages have to be translated into alow-level language, also called machine language . This translation takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. But high-level languages have two major advantages: It ismucheasier to program in a high-level language. Programs take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. High-level languages areportable, meaning they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer. Two kinds of programs translate high-level languages into low-level languages: interpreters and compilers. Aninterpreterreads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations. Figure shows the structure of an interpreter. Figure : How interpreted languages are executed. In contrast, acompilerreads the entire program and translates it completely beforetheprogramstartsrunning. Thehigh-levelprogramiscalledthesource code. The translated program is called theobject code, or theexecutable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation of the source code. As a result, compiled programs often run faster than interpreted programs. Note that object code, as a low-level language, is not portable. You cannot run an executable compiled for a Windows laptop on an Android phone, for Chapter Computer Programming example. Torunaprogramondifferenttypesofmachines, itmustbecompiled multiple times. It can be difficult to write source code that compiles and runs
