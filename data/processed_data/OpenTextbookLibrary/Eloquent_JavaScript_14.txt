or dull spot on the surface of a CD. Any piece of discrete information can be reduced to a sequence of zeros and ones and thus represented in bits. For example, we can express the number in bits. This works the same way as a decimal number, but instead of different digits, we have only , and the weight of each increases by a factor of from right to left. Here are the bits that make up the number , with the weights of the digits shown below them: That s the binary number 00001101. Its nonzero digits stand for , , and , and add up to . Values Imagine a sea of bits an ocean of them. A typical modern computer has more than billion bits in its volatile data storage (working memory). Nonvolatile storage(theharddiskorequivalent)tendstohaveyetafewordersofmagnitude more. To be able to work with such quantities of bits without getting lost, we separate them into chunks that represent pieces of information. In a Java Script environment, thosechunksarecalled values. Thoughallvaluesaremadeofbits, they play different roles. Every value has a type that determines its role. Some values are numbers, some values are pieces of text, some values are functions, and so on. To create a value, you must merely invoke its name. This is convenient. You don t have to gather building material for your values or pay for them. You just call for one, and whoosh, you have it. Of course, values are not really created from thin air. Each one has to be stored somewhere, and if you want to use a gigantic number of them at the same time, you might run out of computer memory. Fortunately, this is a
