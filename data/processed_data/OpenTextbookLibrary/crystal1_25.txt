to the power of ) ()grouping Figure :Python s basic math operators. All this stuff has to appear on theright-hand sideof an equals sign, by the way, never on the left. That may seem surprising, since in mathematics the equations x y and y x mean the same thing. Why does it matter which order you write it in? The answer, you ll recall, is that in a program the symbol doesn t mean isequal to but rather makeequal to. It s not an equation; it s a command. And you can t command y to be equal to anything. Therefore the only thing permitted on the left-hand side of an equals sign is a single, plain-jane variable name. To test your understanding of the syntax, see if you agree that the following math expression: gpa creds gpts1 creds gpts2 creds creds should look like this in Python: gpa (creds1 gpts1 creds2 gpts2) (creds1 creds2) and that this one: a x2y( z) (x q) y 215y 2z 19x3 (yz)(y ) should look like this: . MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS33 a (((x ) y ( -z) (x q) y) ( y z)) ( (x ) - (y z) ((y- ) )) If so, you re good to go. It s tedious, but not complicated. Python also has plenty of functions for absolute value, sine and cosine, logarithms, square roots, and anything else you can think of. We ll learn all those at the proper time (or they re all eminently Google-able if you want to look them up now). A common pattern: cumulative totals Here s a technique we ll use over and over in our code, but which can seem a bit
