more and more people rediscover geography and the power of maps, the future uses and applications of GIS are unlimited. To take full advantage of the benefits of GIS and related geosp atial technology both now and in the future, it is useful to take stock of the ways in which we already think spatially with respect to the world in which we live. In other words, by recognizing and increasing our geographical awareness about how we relate to our local environment and the world at large, we will benefit more from our use and application of GIS. The purpose of this chapter is to increase our geographical awareness and to refine our spatial thinking. First, a simple mental mapping exercise is used to highlight our geographical knowledge and spatial awareness, or lack thereof. Second, fundamental concepts and terms that are central to geographic information systems, and more generally geography, are identified, defined, and explained. This chap ter Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org books Saylor.org concludes with a description of the frameworks that guide the use and application of GIS, as well as its future development.

The objective of this section is to illustrate how we think geographically every day with mental maps and to highlight the importance of asking geographic questions. At no other time in the history of the world has it been easier to create or to acquire a map of nearly anything. Maps and mapping technology are literally and virtually everywhere. Though the modes and means of making and distributing maps have been revolutionized with recent advances in computing like the Internet, the art and science
