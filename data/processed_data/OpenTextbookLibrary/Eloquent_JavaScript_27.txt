A program is a list of statements. The simplest kind of statement is an expression with a semicolon after it. This is a program: ; !false; It is a useless program, though. An expression can be content to just produce a value, which can then be used by the enclosing code. However, a statement stands on its own, so if it doesn t affect the world, it s useless. It may display something on the screen, as with console.log , or change the state of the machine in a way that will affect the statements that come after it. These changes are called side effects . The statements in the previous example just produce the values 1and trueand then immediately throw them away. This leaves no impression on the world at all. When you run this program, nothing observable happens. In some cases, Java Script allows you to omit the semicolon at the end of a statement. In other cases, it has to be there, or the next line will be treated as part of the same statement. The rules for when it can be safely omitted are somewhat complex and error prone. So in this book, every statement that needs a semicolon will always get one. I recommend you do the same, at least until you ve learned more about the subtleties of missing semicolons. Bindings How does a program keep an internal state? How does it remember things? We have seen how to produce new values from old values, but this does not change the old values, and the new value must be used immediately or it will dissipate again. To catch and hold values, Java Script provides
