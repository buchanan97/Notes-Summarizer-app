define bit Read(value, bit) (((value) (bit)) 0x01) define bit Set(value, bit) ((value) ( UL (bit))) define bit Clear(value, bit) ((value) ( UL (bit))) The UL simply means expressed as an unsigned long. Finally, bit could also be defined as a symbol which leads to some nice looking self-documenting code: define LEDBIT more code here bit Set( DDR, LEDBIT ); define expansions can get quite tricky because they can have nested references. This means that one define may contain within it a symbol which is itself a define. Following these can be a little tedious at times but ultimately are worth the effort. We shall look at a few down the road. Remember, these are done to make day-to-day programming easier, not to obfuscate the code. For now, start with simple math constant substitutions. They are extremely useful and easy to use. Just keep in the back of your mind that, with microcontrollers, specific registers and ports are often given symbolic names such as Embedded Controllers PORTB so that you don't have to remember the precise numeric addresses of them. The norm is to place these symbolic constants in ALL CAPS. Keywords Here is a list of keywords in the C language: Figure , C language keywords We ve looked at quite a few of these already. Some that we haven t you can probably guess the use of. As stated previously, C is a skinny language! Exercises . Write a line of code that will print the statement The result is x volts where x is the value given by the floating point variable output voltage. . Write a line of code to define a constant called RECIP2 PI that
