old image le with the new snapshot. Alternatively you may save the image under a new name, as we just did. In addition to the .image le, there is also a .changes le. This le contains a log of all the changes to the source code that you have made using the standard tools. Most of the time you do not need to worry about this le at all. As we shall see, however, the .changes le can be very useful for recovering from errors, or replaying lost changes. More about this later! The image that you have been working with is a descendant of the original Smalltalk- image created in the late 1970s. Some of these objects have been around for decades! You might think that the image is the key mechanism for storing and managing software projects, but you would be wrong. As we shall see very soon, there are much better tools for managing code and sharing software developed by teams. Images are very useful, but you should learn to be very cavalier about creating and throwing away images, since tools like Monticello offer much better ways to manage versions and share code amongst developers. Blue-click on the Blob. You will see a collection of colored dots that are collectively called the blob s morphic halo. Each dot is called a handle . Click in the pink handle containing the cross; the blob should go away. (You may have to try several times as the Blob squirms around and tries to get away from the mouse.)
