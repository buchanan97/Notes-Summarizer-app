the number of gates needed. Why should the number of gates be minimized ? When a gate is actually included in a circuit, it has bad effects: Every gate requires power to operate it. The more gates in the circuit means that power will be need ed to operate the computer. Since gates require power, they produce heat as a result. More gates mean more heat from the CPU. There are always delays in propagating the signal across the gates. The speed of light is very fast, but it is not infinite. The further the electricity has to go to reach the end of the circuit, the longer it takes. So the more gates in the circuit, the slower the CPU. And in modern computers, the speed of light is often the limit ing factor in how fast the CPU can cycle, and thus in the speed of the CPU . Thus the goal in any circuit design is to limit the number of gates in the circuit. For the function f1(A,B,C) in Table , the number of AND gates is , or gates is , and not g ates is , or a total of gates. The question is whether or not the circuit can be implemented in less than gates. Boolean algebra is the mechanism which is used to answer this question. Boolean algebra is just like tradition al algebra in that there are a set of relationships that can be applied to a function to transform it. And those operations are generally somewhat analogous to the operations in traditional algebra, making the transition to Boolean algebra somewhat easier . A list of these relationships is given in
