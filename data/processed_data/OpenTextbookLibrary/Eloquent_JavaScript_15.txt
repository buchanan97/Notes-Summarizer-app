problem only if you need them all simultaneously. As soon as you no longer use a value, it will dissipate, leaving behind its bits to be recycled as building material for the next generation of values. The remainder of this chapter introduces the atomic elements of Java Script programs, that is, the simple value types and the operators that can act on such values. Numbers Values of the numbertype are, unsurprisingly, numeric values. In a Java Script program, they are written as follows: Using that in a program will cause the bit pattern for the number to come into existence inside the computer s memory. Java Script uses a fixed number of bits, of them, to store a single number value. There are only so many patterns you can make with bits, which limits the number of different numbers that can be represented. With Ndecimal digits, you can represent Nnumbers. Similarly, given binary digits, you can represent 264different numbers, which is about quintillion (an with zeros after it). That s a lot. Computer memory used to be much smaller, and people tended to use groups of or bits to represent their numbers. It was easy to accidentally overflow such small numbers to end up with a number that did not fit into the given number of bits. Today, even computers that fit in your pocket have plenty of memory, so you are free to use -bit chunks, and you need to worry about overflow only when dealing with truly astronomical numbers. Not all whole numbers less than quintillion fit in a Java Script number, though. Those bits also store negative numbers, so one bit indicates the sign of the number.
