The World Wide Web (WWW) is another example of distributed, client server computing. The WWW is not a separate physical network. Rather it is a subset of the Internet that uses the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) . A protocol is a set of rules and conventions that govern how communication takes place between two computers. HTTP is a multimedia protocol, which means that it supports the transmission of text, graphics, sound, and other forms of information. Certain computers within a network run special software that enables them to play the role of HTTP (or Web) servers. They store Web documents and are capable of handling requests for documents from client browser applications. The servers and clients can be located anywhere on the Internet. The documents stored on Web servers are encoded in a special textbased language known as Hyper Text Markup Language , or HTML . Web browsers, such as Netscape s Navigator and Microsoft s Internet Explorer, are designed to interpret documents coded in this language. The language itself is very simple. Its basic elements are known as tags, which consist of certain keywords or other text contained within angle brackets, and .
