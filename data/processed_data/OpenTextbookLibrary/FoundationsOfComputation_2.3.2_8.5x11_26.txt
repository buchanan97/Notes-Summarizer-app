t have to be both it could be large and white, it coul d be small and black.) Similarly, for porq to fail to be true, bothpandqmust be false. That is, (p q) is equivalent to ( p) ( q). This is De Morgan s second law. Recalling that p qis equivalent to ( p) q, we can apply De Morgan s law In propositional logic, this is easily veri ed with a small truth tab le. But there is a surprising amount of argument about whether this law is valid in al l situations. In the real world, there often seems to be a gray area between truth and falsity. Even i n mathematics, there are some people who think there should be a third truth value, o ne that means something like unknown or not proven. But the mathematicians who think this way tend to be considered a bit odd by most other mathematicians. . BOOLEAN ALGEBRA to obtain a formula for the negation an implication: (p q) (( p) q) ( ( p)) ( q) p q That is, p qis false exactly when both pis true and qis false. For example, the negation of If you have an ace, you win is You have an ace , and you don t win. Think of it this way: if you had an ace and you didn t win, then the statement If you have an ace, you win was not true.
