word since the pre x . Describe any relationship between Dyck words and Stack push (x) and pop() operations. Exercise . Amatched string is a sequence off,g, (, ), , and characters that are properly matched. For example, ff() gg is a matched string, but this ff() g is not, since the second fis matched with a . Show how to use a stack so that, given a string of length n, you can determine if it is a matched string in O(n) time. Exercise . Suppose you have a Stack ,s, that supports only the push (x) and pop() operations. Show how, using only a FIFO Queue ,q, you can reverse the order of all elements in s. Exercise . Using a USet , implement a Bag. ABagis like a USet it supports the add(x),remove (x) and find (x) methods but it allows duplicate elements to be stored. The find (x) operation in a Bagreturns some element (if any) that is equal to x. In addition, a Bagsupports the find All (x) operation that returns a list of all elements in the Bagthat are equal to x. Exercise . From scratch, write and test implementations of the List , USet and SSet interfaces. These do not have to be e cient. They can be used later to test the correctness and performance of more e cient implementations. (The easiest way to do this is to store the elements in an array.) Exercise . Work to improve the performance of your implementations from the previous question using any tricks you can think of. Experiment and think about how you could improve the performance of add(i;x) and remove (i) in your
