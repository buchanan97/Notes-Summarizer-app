general background to make sense out of more specialized references. Perhaps the most signi cant payo for learning the details of today's systems in the context of the reasons behind their designs is that you will be in a better position to learn tomorrow's systems. You will be able to see in what ways they are di erent and in what ways they are fundamentally still the same. You will be able to put new features into context, often as a new solution to an old problem, or even just as a variant on an existing solution. If you really get excited by what you learn from this book, you could even use your knowledge as the foundation for more advanced study and become one of the people who develops tomorrow's systems. . MULTIPLE COMPUTATIONS ON ONE COMPUTER Second, in addition to knowledge about systems, you will learn some skills that are applicable even outside the context of operating systems and middleware. Some of the most important skills come from the exploration projects. For example, if you take those projects seriously, you'll practice not only conducting experiments, but also writing reports describing the experiments and their results. That will serve you well in many contexts. I have also provided you with some opportunities to develop pro ciency in using the professional literature, such as documentation and the papers published in conference proceedings. Those sources go into more depth than this book can, and they will always be more up-to-date. From the programming projects, you'll gain some skill at writing programs that have several interacting components operating concurrently with one another and that keep their interactions under control. You'll also develop
