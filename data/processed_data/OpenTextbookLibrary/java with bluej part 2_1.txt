Some examples are: . names of students in a class . courses o ered by a department . temperatures for the last month . employees in a company The above cases all have one thing in common: in each case there can be more than one value. For instance, there would be several students in a class and for each student there is a name, for example: "John", "Mary", "Lee", etc. In Java, one way of handling a collection like this is to use a data structure called an array . The array is declared similar to other variables and then an integer (called an index) is used to refer to its elements individually. So,student Name can be the name of the collection and student Name , student Name ,student Name , etc. is the way we refer to elements of the collection. To declare an array of names where each element of the array can be a String value we use: String student Name; The square braces are used to indicate a one-dimensional array. Its called one-dimensional because one index value is used to refer to an individual element of the array. In Java index values begin at and go up to the length of the array - . We can declare arrays of any type, for example: CHAPTER . ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS declaration sample purpose String student Name; an array of names int mark; an array of marks double
