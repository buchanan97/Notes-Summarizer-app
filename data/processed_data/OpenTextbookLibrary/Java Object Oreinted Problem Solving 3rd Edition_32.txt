An instance variable (orinstance method ) is a variable (or method) that belongs to an object. By contrast, a class variable (orclass method ) is a variable (or method) that is associated with the class itself. An example will help make this distinction clear. An instance variable will have different values for different instances. For example, individual Rectangle s will have different values for their length ,width ,x, and yvariables. So these are examples of instance variables. The calculate Area() method is an example of an instance method because it uses the instance s current length and width values in its calculation. Similarly, the draw() method is an instance method, because it uses the object s length and width to draw the object s shape. An example of a class variable would be a variable in the Rectangle class that is used to keep track of how many individual Rectangle s have been created. (Our drawing program might need this information to help manage its memory resources.) Suppose we name this variable n Rectangles and suppose we add to it each time a new Rectangle instance is created. An example of a method that is associated with the class is a special method known as a constructor . This is a method used to create an object. It is used to create an instance of a class. Calling a constructor to create an object is like pressing the cookie cutter into the cookie dough: the result is an individual cookie (object). Figure illustrates these concepts. Note that class variables are underlined in the UML diagram. We have modi ed the Rectangle class to include its constructor method, which is named
