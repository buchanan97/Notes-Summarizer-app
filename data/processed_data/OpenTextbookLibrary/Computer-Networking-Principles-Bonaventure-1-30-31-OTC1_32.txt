OSI reference model There is now a rough consensus for the greater use of the Unicode character format. Unicode can represent more than , different characters from the known written languages on Earth. Maybe one day, all computers will only use Unicode to represent all their stored characters and Unicode could become the standard format to exchange characters, but we are not yet at this stage today.

Most of the classical networking textbooks chose a bottom-up approach, i.e. they rst explained all the electrical and optical details of the physical layer then moved to the datalink layer. This approach worked well during the infancy of computer networks and until the late 1990s. At that time, most students were not users of computer networks and it was useful to explain computer networks by building the corresponding protocols from the simplest, in the physical layer, up to the application layer. Today, all students are active users of Internet applications, and starting to learn computer networking by looking at bits is not very motivating. Starting from Kurose Ross09 , many textbooks and teachers have chosen a top-down approach. This approach starts from applications such as email and web that students already know and explores the different layers, starting from the application layer. This approach works qui
