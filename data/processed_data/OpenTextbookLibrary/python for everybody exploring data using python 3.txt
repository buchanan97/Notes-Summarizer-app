This book is an experiment in not starting from scratch, but instead remixi ng the book titled Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist written by Allen B. Downey, Je Elkner, and others. In December of 2009, I was preparing to teach SI502 - Networked Programming at the University of Michigan for the fth semester in a row and decided it was time to write a Python textbook that focused on exploring data instead of understanding algorithms and abstractions. My goal in SI502 is to teach people lifelong data handling skills using Python. Few of my students were planning to be professional computer programmers. Instead, they planned to be librarians, managers, lawyers, biologists, economists, etc., who happened to want
