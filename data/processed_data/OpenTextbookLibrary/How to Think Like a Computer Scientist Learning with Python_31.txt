complains about one of your variable names and you don t know why, see if it is on this list. Statements A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. We have seen two kinds of statements: print and assignment. When you type a statement on the command line, Python executes it and displays the result, if there is one. The result of a print statement is a value. Assignment statements don t produce a result. A script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute. For example, the script print x print x produces the output Variables, expressions and statements Again, the assignment statement produces no output. Evaluating expressions An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. If you type an expression on the command line, the interpreter evaluates it and displays the result: Although expressions contain values, variables, and operators, not every expres - sion contains all of these elements. A value all by itself is considered an expres sion, and so is a variable. x Confusingly, evaluating an expression is not quite the same thing as printing a value. message Hello, World! message Hello, World! print message Hello, World! When the Python interpreter displays the value of an expression, it uses the same format you would use to enter a value. In the case of strings, that means that i t includes the quotation marks. But if you use a print statement, Python display s the contents of the string without the quotation marks. In a script, an expression all by itself is a legal statement, but
