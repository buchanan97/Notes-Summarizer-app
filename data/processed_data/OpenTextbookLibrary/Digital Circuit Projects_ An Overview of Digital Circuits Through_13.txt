The role of chapter has been moved to chapter , which shows the ICs in the context of a working CPU developed by the author. IV Using this book in a class on Computer Organization The central question for professors looking to use this book is how the book can be applied to their classes. The following is an outline of how I use this text in a Computer Organization class. In a class on Computer Organization I generally do not get into CPU data path un til the eighth week of the semester. For the first seven weeks of the semester I cover background material. The first two weeks of the semester I cover a basic review of material that I find students often DIGITAL CIRCUIT PROJ ECTS do not understand well. Boolean Algebra, binary mathematics ( 's complement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and floating point number format. The next five weeks of the semester are spent covering assembly code. I find this is important for two reasons. First the students sho uld know how their higher level programs are translated into programs which the computer can execute. It allows the students to see all data in a computer as just a binary number, and to understand concepts such as variables and pointers to variables. Second teaching assembly shows the translation by the assembler of the student's program into machine language, and the format of machine code. Understanding how a program is presented to the hardware is important to the understanding of how the CPU execut es the program. This leaves the last weeks of a semester for actually studying the data path which defines the CPU. In
