the top of every le (and assume I ve done the same). The Typed PLAI language differs from traditional Racket most importantly by being statically typed. It also gives you some useful new constructs: define-type , type-case , and test . Here s an example of each in use. We can introduce new There are additional commands for controlling the output of testing, for instance. Be sure to read the documentation for the language In Dr Racket v. , go to Help, then Help Desk, and in the Help Desk search bar, type plai-typed .datatypes: (define-type Misspelled Animal caml (humps : number) yacc (height : number) ) You can roughly think of this as analogous to the following in Java: an abstract class Misspelled Animal and two concrete sub-classes caml andyacc , each of which has one numeric constructor argument named humps andheight , respectively. In this language, we construct instances as follows: (caml ) (yacc ) As the name suggests, define-type creates a type of the given name. We can use this when, for instance, binding the above instances to names: (define ma1 : Misspelled Animal (caml )) (define ma2 : Misspelled Animal (yacc )) In fact you don t need these particular type declarations, because Typed PLAI will infer types for you here and in many other cases. Thus you could just as well have written (define ma1 (caml )) (define ma2 (yacc )) but we prefer to write explicit type declarations as a matter of both discipline and comprehensibility when we return to programs later. The type names can even be used recursively, as we will see repeatedly in this book (for instance, section ). The language
