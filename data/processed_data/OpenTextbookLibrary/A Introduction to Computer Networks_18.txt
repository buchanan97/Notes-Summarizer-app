packets; see The LAN Layer . The physical layer is generally of direct concern only to those designing LAN hardware; the kernel software interface to the LAN corresponds to the logical LAN layer. This LAN physical logical division gives us the Internet ve-layer model . This is less a formal hierarchy than an ad hoc classi cation method. We will return to this below in IETF and OSI , where we will also introduce two more rather obscure layers that complete the seven -layer model. An Introduction to Computer Networks, Release Application Transport IP Logical LAN Physical LAN Fig. :: Five-layer network model Data Rate, Throughput and Bandwidth Any one network connection egat the LAN layer has a data rate : the rate at which bits are transmitted. In some LANs ( eg Wi-Fi) the data rate can vary with time. Throughput refers to the overall effective transmission rate, taking into account things like transmission overhead, protocol inef ciencies and perhaps even competing traf c. It is generally measured at a higher network layer than the data rate. The term bandwidth can be used to refer to either of these, though we here use it mostly as a synonym for data rate. The term comes from radio transmission, where the width of the frequency band available is proportional, all else being equal, to the data rate that can be achieved. In discussions about TCP, the term goodput is sometimes used to refer to what might also be called application-layer throughput : the amount of usable data delivered to the receiving application. Specifically, retransmitted data is counted only once when calculating goodput but might be counted twice under some interpretations of
