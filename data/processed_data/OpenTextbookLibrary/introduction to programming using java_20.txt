CPU needs data from the disk, it sends a signal t o the disk drive telling it to locate the data and get it ready. (This signal is sent synch ronously, under the control of a regular program.) Then, instead of just waiting the long an d unpredictable amount of time that the disk drive will take to do this, the CPU goes on with so me other task. When the disk drive has the data ready, it sends an interrupt signal to the C PU. The interrupt handler can then read the requested data. Now, you might have noticed that all this only makes sense if t he CPU actually has several tasks to perform. If it has nothing better to do, it might as we ll spend its time polling for input or waiting for disk drive operations to complete. All modern computers use multitasking to perform several tasks at once. Some computers can be used by s everal people at once. Since the CPU is so fast, it can quickly switch its attention from one us er to another, devoting a fraction of a second to each user in turn. This application of multitas king is called timesharing . But a modern personal computer with just a single user also uses mu ltitasking. For example, the user might be typing a paper while a clock is continuously display ing the time and a le is being downloaded over the network. Each of the individual tasks that the CPU is working on is call ed athread. (Or aprocess; there are technical di erences between threads and process es, but they are not important here, since it is threads
