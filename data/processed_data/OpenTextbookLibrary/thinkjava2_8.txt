a symbolic computation, like searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program. The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language: The Hello World Program input:Get data from the keyboard, a file, a sensor, or some other device. output:Display data on the screen, or send data to a file or other device. math:Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and division. decision:Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code. repetition:Perform an action repeatedly, usually with some variation. Believe it or not, that s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of small instructions that look much like these. So you can think ofprogrammingas the process of breaking down a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks. The process continues until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with the electronic circuits provided by the hardware. The Hello World Program Traditionally, the first program you write when learning a new programming language is called the Hello World program. All it does is output the words Hello, World!to the screen. In Java, it looks like this: public class Hello public static void main(String args) generate some simple output System.out.println("Hello, World!"); When this program runs, it displays the following: Hello, World! Notice that the output does not include the quotation marks. Java programs are made up ofclassandmethoddefinitions, and methods are made up ofstatements. Astatementis a line of code that performs a basic Chapter Computer Programming action. In the Hello World program, this line is aprint statementthat displays a message to the user: System.out.println("Hello, World!");
