operators are evaluated rst, followed by any operators, followed by any operators. For example, the expression p q ris equivalent to the expression ( p) (q r), whilep q q risequivalent to p (q q) r. As apractical matter, when you make up your own expressions, it is usually better to put i n parentheses to make your meaning clear. Remember that even if you leave out p arentheses, your expression has an unambiguous meaning. If you say p q when what you meant was (p q), you ve got it wrong! This still leaves open the question of which of the operators in the expression p q ris evaluated rst. This is settled by the following rule: Whe n several operators of equal precedence occur in the absence o f parentheses, they CHAPTER .

Thus, the expression p q ris equivalent to (p q) rrather than to p (q r). In this particular case, as a matter of fact, it doesn t really matter which operator is evaluated rst, since the two compound propositions ( p q) randp (q r) always have the same value, no matter what logical values
