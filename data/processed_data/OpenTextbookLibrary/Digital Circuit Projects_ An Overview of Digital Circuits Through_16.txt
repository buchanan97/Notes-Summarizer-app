l ogic components called gates . These gates are very, very tiny, and very, very fast, but they are just electronic circuits which perform simple operations. The only operations these gates need to provide are the Boolean AND , OR , and NOT operators , which will be explained in Chapter . More surprisingly, AND, OR and NOT functions are more than what is needed. All of the logic in a computer can be implemented using only one type of gate, the Not -AND, or NAND, gate. Thus a computer is simply a collection of these wires and gates, and can be completely explained as a mechanical device using only one type of computational element, the NAND gate. This really is almost as amazing as computers being made of magic, but much more useful. To simplify the CPU, collections of AND, OR and NOT gates are organized into digital components (called Integrated Circuit s, or ICs) which are used to build the CPU. These digital ICs are called multiplexors, decoders, flip- flops (registers) and Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs). Some of these components, such a s the ALU, are made up of other digital components, such a s adders, subtracters, comparators, and circuits to do other types of calculations . This book will cover these digital IC s, explaining how they are used in a CPU, showing how these digi tal components are made using simple gates, and actually implementing the circuits on a breadboard using IC chips. Once completing this book, the reader should have a concept of what is a CPU, a good understanding of the parts which make up a CPU, and a rudimentary concept of how a
