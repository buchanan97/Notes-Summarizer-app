start ,end, andduration . If you modify ts, these properties change accordingly. To modify a wave, you can access the tsandysdirectly. For example: wave.ys wave.ts The rst line scales the wave by a factor of , making it louder. The second line shifts the wave in time, making it start second later. But Wave provides methods that perform many common operations. For example, the same two transformations could be written: . Signal objects wave.scale( ) wave.shift( ) You can read the documentation of these methods and others at http: greenteapress.com thinkdsp.html . Signal objects Signal is a parent class that provides functions common to all kinds of signals, likemake wave . Child classes inherit these methods and provide evaluate , which evaluates the signal at a given sequence of times. For example, Sinusoid is a child class of Signal, with this de nition: class Sinusoid(Signal): def init (self, freq , amp , offset , func np.sin): Signal. init (self) self.freq freq self.amp amp self.offset offset self.func func The parameters of init are: freq : frequency in cycles per second, or Hz. amp: amplitude. The units of amplitude are arbitrary, usually chosen so corresponds to the maximum input from a microphone or maximum output to a speaker. offset : indicates where in its period the signal starts; offset is in units of radians, for reasons I explain below. func : a Python function used to evaluate the signal at a particular point in time. It is usually either np.sin ornp.cos , yielding a sine or cosine signal. Like many init methods, this one just tucks the parameters away for future use. Signal provides make wave , which looks like this: Chapter
