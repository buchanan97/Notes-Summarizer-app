rst then the value o f the semaphore will be incremented, and when Thread B gets to the wait, it wil l proceed im12 Basic synchronization patterns mediately. Either way, the order of a1andb1is guaranteed. This use of semaphores is the basis of the names signalandwait, and in this case the names are conveniently mnemonic. Unfortuna tely, we will see other cases where the names are less helpful. Speaking of meaningful names, semisn t one. When possible, it is a good idea to give a semaphore a name that indicates what it represe nts. In this case a name like a1 Donemight be good, so that a1done.signal() means signal that a1 is done, and a1done.wait() means wait until a1 is done. Sync.py TODO: write about using sync, starting with signal.py Why does Thread B signal init Complete ? Rendezvous Puzzle: Generalize the signal pattern so that it works both w ays. Thread A has to wait for Thread B and vice versa. In other words, given this code Thread A 1statement a1 2statement a2 Thread B 1statement b1 2statement b2 we want to guarantee that a1happens before b2andb1happens before a2. In writing your solution, be sure to specify the names and initi al values of your semaphores (little hint there). Your solution should not enforce too many constraints. For e xample, we don t care about the order of a1andb1. In your solution, either order should be possible. This synchronization problem has a name; it s a rendezvous. The idea is that two threads rendezvous at a point of execution, and neit her is allowed to proceed until both have arrived. Rendezvous Rendezvous hint The chances are good that you
