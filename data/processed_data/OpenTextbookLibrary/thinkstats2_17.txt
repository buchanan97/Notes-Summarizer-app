imported into another, errors might be introduced. And when you are getting familiar with a new dataset, you might interpret data incorrectly or introduce other misunderstandings. If you take time to validate the data, you can save time later and avoid errors. One way to validate data is to compute basic statistics and compare them with published results. For example, the NSFG codebook includes tables that summarize each variable. Here is the table for outcome , which encodes the outcome of each pregnancy: value label Total LIVE BIRTH 9148 INDUCED ABORTION 1862 STILLBIRTH MISCARRIAGE 1921 ECTOPIC PREGNANCY CURRENT PREGNANCY The Series class provides a method, value counts , that counts the number of times each value appears. If we select the outcome Series from the Data Frame, we can use value counts to compare with the published data: df.outcome.value counts().sort index() 9148 . Validation 1862 1921 The result of value counts is a Series; sort index() sorts the Series by index, so the values appear in order. Comparing the results with the published table, it looks like the values in outcome are correct. Similarly, here is the published table for birthwgt lb value label Total . INAPPLICABLE 4449 - UNDER POUNDS 1125 POUNDS 2223 POUNDS 3049 POUNDS 1889 - POUNDS OR MORE And here are the value counts: df.birthwgt lb.value counts(sort False) 2223 3049 1889 Chapter . Exploratory data analysis The counts for , , and pounds check out, and if you add up the counts for - and - , they check out, too. But if you look more closely, you will notice one value that has to be an error, a pound baby! To deal with this error,
