that, somewhat ambiguously at the programmer's choice, has either of the following two interpretations: type Rect record top, left, bottom, right: integer end; type Rect record top Left, bot Right: Point end; with one of the interpretations of type 'Point' being type Point record v, h: integer end; Exhibit illustrates and provides more information about these concepts. It shows a plane with first coordinate v that runs from top to bottom, and a second coordinate h that runs from left to right. (The reason for v running from top to bottom, rather than vice versa as used in math books, is compatibility with text coordinates where lines are naturally numbered from top to bottom.) The domain of v and h are the integers from 32768 to 32767. The points thus addressed on the screen are shown as intersections of grid lines. These lines and grid points are infinitely thin - they have no extension. The pixels are the unit squares between them. Each pixel is paired with its top left grid point. This may be enough information to let us draw a slightly fat point of radius pixels at the grid point with integer coordinates (v, h) by calling Paint Oval(v , h , v , h ); Exhibit : Screen coordinates define the location of pixels. To understand the procedures of this section, the reader has to understand a few details about two key aspects of interactive graphics: timing and synchronization of devices and program execution how screen pictures are controlled at the pixel level This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License Synchronization In interactive applications we often wish to specify a grid point by letting
