jarring the first time you see it. Check out this line of code: balance balance Now there is no universe where that statement is truemathematically. (Think about it: can you come up with any number that is equal to itself plus fifty? I thought not.) But again, this is programming, notalgebra. We recommandingthebalancevariableto have a new value. And what is that new value? Simple: whatever itspreviousvalue was, plus . The net effect is to increasebalance s value by . Follow this: balance 1000 print("In July, I had .".format(balance)) balance balance print("In August, I had .".format(balance)) balance balance - balance balance print("In September, I had .".format(balance)) In July, I had 1000. In August, I had 1050. In September, I had . CHAPTER . CALCULATIONS You get the idea. This approach will become especially useful when we get toloopsin Chapter , because we ll be able to repeatedly incrementa variable s value by a desired amount in automated fashion. A couple other things. First, a very common special case of the above is to increment a variable by exactlyone: number of home runs number of home runs Thisallowsustocounttheoccurrencesofvariousthings: everytime somebody hits a home run (or whatever), the above line of code will increase the appropriatecounter variable s value by one. Second, Python has a special alternative syntax for this incrementing operation. It looks weird: balance number of home runs The two characters and (pronounced plus-equals ) allow us to shorthand this operation and avoid typing the variable name twice. The above two lines of code areexactsynonyms for these: balance balance number of home runs number of home runs You can use whichever one you wish, although be aware that your fellow programmers
