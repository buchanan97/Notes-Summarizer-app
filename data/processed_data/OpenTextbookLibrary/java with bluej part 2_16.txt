CHAPTER . ARRAYS OF ARRAYS Ragged Arrays Recall how two dimensional arrays are actually arrays of arrays. Its possible then that rows can have di erent numbers of elements. For example suppose we have ve drivers who drive trucks delivering goods, and for each driver and delivery we keep track of the kilometres they drive. If it is the case that the number of deliveries varies for these drivers we can use a two dimensional array; consider the following sample data: Figure : Five drivers with varying numbers of trips. The program in Listing initializes the array with rows, one per driver, and varying elements for each array that makes up a row. Following the program listing is
