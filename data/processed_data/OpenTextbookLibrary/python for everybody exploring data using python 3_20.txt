posts. You could pri nt out the stream of Facebook posts and pore over the text looking for the most com mon word, but that would take a long time and be very mistake prone. You would be smart to write a Python program to handle the task quickly and accurately so you can spend the weekend doing something fun. For example, look at the following text about a clown and a car. Look at the t ext and gure out the most common word and how many times it occurs. . THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF PROGRAMS the clown ran after the car and the car ran into the tent and the tent fell down on the clown and the car Then imagine that you are doing this task looking at millions of lines of tex t. Frankly it would be quicker for you to learn Python and write a Python pro gram to count the words than it would be to manually scan the words. The even better news is that I already came up with a simple program to nd the most common word in a text le. I wrote it, tested it, and now I am giving it to you to use so you can save some time. name input( quotesingle.ts1 Enter file: quotesingle.ts1 ) handle open(name, quotesingle.ts1r quotesingle.ts1) counts dict() for line inhandle: words line.split() forword inwords: counts word counts.get(word, ) bigcount None bigword None for word, count inlist(counts.items()): ifbigcount is None orcount bigcount: bigword word bigcount count print(bigword, bigcount) Code: https: www.py4e.com code3 words.py You don t even need to know Python to use this program. You will need to get through Chapter of this
