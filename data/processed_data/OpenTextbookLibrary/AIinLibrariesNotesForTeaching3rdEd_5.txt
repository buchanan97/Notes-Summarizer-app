Often the AI algorithms are coupled with the use of outside data. The problems in question are ones that an ideally rational and intelligent human being would be able to solve, given the time, resources, and ingenuity. One of the first examples of an AI program within librarianship is that of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Patrons with poor vision might not be able to read all the books that a library contains. Yet a human library assistant could read books aloud or transcribe them into braille or some other assistive medium. In the mid-1970s, Ray Kurzweil devised and assembled computing machines that did OCR and text-to-speech synthesis. The machines could read books aloud. Kurzweil machines are a massively enabling technology, removing barriers in the access to information. At their core is an AI problem, the problem of recognizing text i.e. classifying letters, and classifying words (where those word tokens might be of different sizes, fonts, colors etc.). AI in libraries should be distinguished both from automation and from the plain use of computers. Libraries have been taking advantage of automated processes for almost as long as there have been libraries. For example, the Gutenberg printing press, from 1440, is a form of automation; it automates the production of books and
