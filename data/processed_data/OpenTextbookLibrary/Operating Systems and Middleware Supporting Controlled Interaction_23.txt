of the book, you need to work exercises, carry out projects, and occasionally venture down one of the side trails pointed out by the end-of-chapter notes. Some of the exploration projects will speci cally direct you to do research in outside sources, such as on the Internet or in a library. Others will call upon you to do experimental work, such as measuring the performance consequences of a particular design choice. If you are going to invest that kind of time and e ort, you deserve some idea of what you stand to gain from it. Therefore, I will explain in the following paragraphs how you will be more knowledgeable and skilled after nishing the book. First, you will gain a general knowledge of how contemporary operating systems and middleware work and some idea why they work that way. That knowledge may be interesting in its own right, but it also has practical applications. Recall that these systems provide supporting APIs for application programmers to use. Therefore, one payo will be that if you program applications, you will be positioned to make more e ective use of the supporting APIs. This is true even though you won't be an expert at any particular API; instead, you'll see the big picture of what services those APIs provide. Another payo will be if you are in a role where you need to alter the con guration of an operating system or middleware product in order to tune its performance or make it best serve a particular context. Again, this one book alone won't give you all the speci c knowledge you need about any particular system, but it will give you the
