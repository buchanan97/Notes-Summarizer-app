entire maze except for islands inside of it. Finally, think about a robot that could identify simple patterns using vision, has distance sensors to avoid walls, and an odometer to keep track of its wheel rotations. Using these capabilities, a potential winning strategy would be to explore the environment, identify markers in the environment using vision and use them to create a map of all feeder locations, calculate the shortest path from feeder to feeder and keep going back and forth between them. Strategy-wise, it might make sense to wait just in front of the feeder and approach it only shortly before the robot runs out of power. . Introduction . Autonomous mobile robots: some core challenges Being able to stitch sensor information together to map the environment just by counting your own steps and orienting yourself by using distinct features of the environment is known as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The key challenge here is that the length of the steps you take are uncertain (a wheeled robot might slip or have slightly differently sized wheels) and it is not possible to recognize places with accuracy (even humans can have trouble with this). In order to be able to implement something like the last algorithm on a real robot, we will therefore need to understand: How does a robot move? How does the rotation of its wheels affect its position and speed in the world? How might we to control the wheel speed in order to reach a desired position? What sensors exist for a robot to perceive its own status and its environment? How can we extract structured information (e.g., features of the world) from this vast
