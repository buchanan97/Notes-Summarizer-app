retaining enough familiarity to be broadly adoptable. The following table indicates the placement within this text of knowledge units from CS2008's computer science body of knowledge. Those knowledge units designated as core units within CS2008 are listed in italics. The book covers all core operating systems (OS) units, as well as one elective OS unit. The overall amount of coverage for each unit is always at least that recommended by CS2008, though sometimes the speci c subtopics don't quite correspond exactly. Outside the OS area, this book's most substantial coverage is of Net-Centric Computing (NC); another major topic, transaction processing, comes from Information Management (IM). In each row, the listed chapters contain the bulk of the knowledge unit's coverage, though xvi PREFACE some topics may be elsewhere.

Bug reports can earn you a bounty of apiece as a token of gratitude. (The great computer scientist Donald Knuth started this tradition. Given how close to bug-free his publications have become, it seems to work.) For purposes of this reward, the de nition of a bug is simple: if as a result of your comment the author chooses to make a change, then you have pointed out
