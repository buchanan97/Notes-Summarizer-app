often teaches differential equations, mathematical modeling, multivariable calculus and numerical analysis, as well as a variety of other courses. He has guided a number of successful undergraduate research projects related to modeling of complex systems, and is currently interested in applications of such models to education, both in terms of teaching and learning and of the educational system as a whole. Outside of the of ce, he can often be found training in various martial arts or enjoying life with his wife and two cats. To Mari Preface This is an introductory textbook about the concepts and techniques of mathematical computational modeling and analysis developed in the emerging interdisciplinary eld of complex systems science. Complex systems can be informally de ned as networks of many interacting components that may arise and evolve through self-organization. Many realworld systems can be modeled and understood as complex systems, such as political organizations, human cultures languages, national and international economies, stock markets, the Internet, social networks, the global climate, food webs, brains, physiological systems, and even gene regulatory networks within a single cell; essentially, they are everywhere. In all of these systems, a massive amount of microscopic components are interacting with each other in nontrivial ways, where important information resides in the relationships between the parts and not necessarily within the parts themselves. It is therefore imperative to model and analyze how such interactions form and operate in order to understand what will emerge at a macroscopic scale in the system. Complex systems science has gained an increasing amount of attention from both inside and outside of academia over the last few decades. There are many excellent books already published, which can introduce you
