others may contribute to and maintaining a consistent curriculum that others can refer to. We are incredibly grateful to MIT Press and our editor Elizabeth Swayne to support this forward-looking model. Writing this book would not have been possible without the excellent work of others before us, most notably Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control by John Craig and Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots by Roland Siegwart, Illah Nourbakhsh and Davide Scaramuzza, and innumerable other books and websites from which I learned and borrowed examples and notation. We are also grateful to Brian Amberg, Aaron Becker, Bachir El-Kadir, James Grime, Michael Sambol, Cyrill Stachniss, Subh83, Ethan Tiran-Thompson who made lecture video snippets and animations available online, and which are referenced throughout the book using QR codes. I would like to acknowledge Mike Miles and Harel Biggie, graduate students in the authors shared laboratory at the University of Colorado Boulder, for their careful reading and contributions. Finally, I would also like to Contents acknowledge Github users Al Wi Vo, beardicus, mguida22, aokeson, as1ndu, apnorton, John Allen, jmodares, countsoduku, choffmann, and chrstphrdlz for their pull requests and comments as well as Haluk Bayram.
