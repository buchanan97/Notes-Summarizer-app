Distance refers to the degree or amount of separation between locations and can be measured in nominal or absolute terms with various units. We can describe the distances between locations n ominally as large or small, or we can describe two or more locations as near or far apart. Absolute distance is measured or calculated using a standard metric. The formula for the distance between two points on a planar (i.e., flat) surface is the following: D (x2 x1) (y2 y1) Calculating the distance between two locations on the surface of the earth, ho wever, is a bit more involved because we are dealing with a three- dimensional object. Moving from the three -dimensional earth to two - dimensional maps on paper, computer screens, and mobile devices is not a trivial matter and is discussed in greater detail in Chapter "Map Anatomy" . We also use a variety of units to measure distance. For instance, the distance between London and Singapore can be measured in miles, kilometers, flight time on a jumbo jet, or days on a cargo ship. Whether or not such distances make London and Singapore near or far from each other is a matter of opinion, experience, and patience. Hence the use of absolute distance metrics, such as that derived from the distance formula, provide a standardized method to measure how far away o r how near locations are from each other.
