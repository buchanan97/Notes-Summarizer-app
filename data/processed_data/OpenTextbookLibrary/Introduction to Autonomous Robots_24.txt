application. For example, a simple mobile robot would typically require a representation with respect to a room, a building, or the earth s coordinate system (given by the longitude and latitude of each point on earth), whereas a static manipulator usually has the origin of its coordinate system at its base. More complicated systems, such as mobile manipulators or multi-legged robots, make life much easier by defining multiple coordinate systems, e.g. one for each leg and one that describes the position of the robot in the world frame. These local coordinate systems are known as Frames of Reference . An example of two nested coordinate systems is shown in Figure . In this example, a robot located at the origin of x , y and z might plan its motions in its own reference frame, which can then be expressed in the coordinate system x,yandzby performing a translation and a rotation as we will later see. Depending on its degrees of freedom in Cartesian space that is, the number of independent translations and rotations a robot can achieve in such a space it is also customary to ignore components of position and orientation that remain constant. For example, a simple floor-cleaning robot s pose might be completely defined by its xandycoordinates in a room as well as its orientation, i.e. its rotation around the z-axis. In this case, zposition and rotation around xandyaxes would be ignored. . Matrix notation Given some kind of fixed coordinate system, we can describe the position of a robot s end-effector by a position vector. As there can be many coordinate systems defined on a robot and the environment, we identify the coordinate system a
