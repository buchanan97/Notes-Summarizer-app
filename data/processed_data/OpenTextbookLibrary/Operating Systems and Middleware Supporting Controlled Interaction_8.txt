service provider's email server. Chapter provides an overview of networking, including the services that operating systems make available to programs such as the email client and server. Chapter extends this discussion into the more sophisticated forms of support provided by communication middleware, such as messaging systems, RMI, and web services. Finally, Chapter focuses on security. Because security is a pervasive issue, the preceding ten chapters all provide some information on it as well. Speci cally, the nal section of each chapter points out ways in which security relates to that chapter's particular topic. However, even with that coverage distributed throughout the book, a chapter speci cally on security is needed, primarily to elevate it out of technical particulars and talk about general principles and the human and organizational context surrounding PREFACE xv the computer technology. The best way to use these chapters is in consecutive order. However, Chapter can be omitted with only minor harm to Chapters and , and Chapter can be omitted if students are already su ciently familiar with networking. Relationship to Computer Science Curriculum 2008 Operating systems are traditionally the subject of a course required for all computer science majors. In recent years, however, there has been increasing interest in the idea that upper-level courses should be centered less around particular artifacts, such as operating systems, and more around crosscutting concepts. In particular, the Computing Curricula 2001 (CC2001) and its interim revision, Computer Science Curriculum 2008 (CS2008), provide encouragement for this approach, at least as one option. Most colleges and universities still retain a relatively traditional operating systems course, however. Therefore, this book steers a middle course, moving in the direction of the cross-cutting concerns while
