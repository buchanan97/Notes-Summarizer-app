a call to get( ) would return the value c. of values. The List interface includes the following operations: .size (): return n, the length of the list .get(i): return the value xi .set(i;x): set the value of xiequal to x .add(i;x): add xat position i, displacing xi;:::;xn ; Setxj xj, for allj2fn ;:::;ig, increment n, and set xi x .remove (i) remove the value xi, displacing xi ;:::;xn ; Setxj xj , for allj2fi;:::;n 2gand decrement n Notice that these operations are easily su cient to implement the Deque interface: add First (x)) add( ;x) remove First ()) remove ( ) add Last (x)) add(size ();x) remove Last ()) remove (size () ) Although we will normally not discuss the Stack ,Deque and FIFO Queue interfaces in subsequent chapters, the terms Stack and Deque are sometimes used in the names of data structures that implement the List interface. When this happens, it highlights the fact that these data structures can be used to implement the Stack or Deque interface very e ciently. For example, the Array Deque class is an implementation of the List interface that implements all the Deque operations in constant time per operation. Introduction The USet Interface: Unordered Sets The USet interface represents an unordered set of unique elements, which mimics a mathematical set. AUSet contains ndistinct elements; no element appears more than once; the elements are in no speci c order. A USet supports the following operations: .size (): return the number, n, of elements in the set .add(x): add the element xto the set if not already present; Add xto the set provided that there is no element yin the set such that xequals
