In general, the ultimate goal of D graphics is to produce D images of the D world. The transformation from D to D invol vesviewing andprojection . The world looks di erent when seen from di erent points of vi ew. To set up a point of view, we need to specify the position of the viewer and the directio n that the viewer is looking. It is also necessary to specify an up direction, a direction t hat will be pointing upwards in the nal image. This can be thought of as placing a virtual camer a into the scene. Once the view is set up, the world as seen from that point of view can be p rojected into D. Projection is analogous to taking a picture with the camera. The nal step in D graphics is to assign colors to individual pixels in the D image. This process is called rasterization , and the whole process of producing an image is referred to as rendering the scene. In many cases the ultimate goal is not to create a single image , but to create an animation , consisting of a sequence of images that show the world at di e rent times. In an animation, there are small changes from one image in the sequence to the next. A lmost any aspect of a scene can change during an animation, including coordinates of pr imitives, transformations, material properties, and the view. For example, an object can be made t o grow over the course of an animation by gradually increasing the scale factor in a scal ing transformation that is applied to the object. And changing the
