a 's complement number. The second step adds a to the number . 11010011 00000001 11010100 . Thus the result of a 's complement operation on 00101100 is 11010100 , or negative 's complement value. This process is reversible, as the reader can easily show that the 's complement value of 11010100 is 00101100 . Also note that both the negative and positive values are in 's complement representation. While positive numbers will begin with a in the left most position, and negative numbers will begin with a in the leftmost position, these are not just sign bits in the same sense as the signed magnitude number , but part of the representation of the number. To understand this difference, consider the case where the positive and negative numbers used above are to be represented in bits, not bits. The first number, which is positive, will extend the sign of the number, which is . As we all know, adding 's to the left of a positive number does not change the number. So 00101100 would become 0000000000101100 . However, the negative value cannot extend to the left . If for no other reason, this results in a in the sign bit, and the negative number has been made positive. So to extend the negative number 11010100 to bits requires that the sign bit, in this case , be extended. Thus 11010100 becomes 1111111111010100 . The left most (or high) bit in the number is normally referred to as a sign bit, a conv ention this text will continue. But it is important to remember it is not a single bit that determines the sign of the number, but a
