of the very good (and free) textbook on mathematics for computer science . Exponentials and Logarithms The expression bxdenotes the number braised to the power of x. Ifxis a positive integer, then this is just the value of bmultiplied by itself x times: bx b b b z x: Whenxis a negative integer, bx b x. Whenx ,bx . Whenbis not an integer, we can still de ne exponentiation in terms of the exponential functionex(see below), which is itself de ned in terms of the exponential series, but this is best left to a calculus text. In this book, the expression logbkdenotes the base-blogarithm ofk. That is, the unique value xthat satis es bx k : Most of the logarithms in this book are base ( binary logarithms ). For these, we omit the base, so that log kis shorthand for log2k. An informal, but useful, way to think about logarithms is to think of logbkas the number of times we have to divide kbybbefore the result is less than or equal to . For example, when one does binary search, each comparison reduces the number of possible answers by a factor of . This is repeated until there is at most one possible answer. Therefore, the number of comparison done by binary search when there are initially at mostn possible answers is at most dlog2(n )e. Another logarithm that comes up several times in this book is the natural logarithm . Here we use the notation ln kto denote logek, wheree Euler s constant is given by e lim n! n n :71828: Mathematical Background The natural logarithm comes up frequently because it is the value of a particularly
