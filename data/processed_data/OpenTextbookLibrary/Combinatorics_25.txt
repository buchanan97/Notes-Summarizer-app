of heads he gets might be zero, one, two, or three, so there are four possible outcomes (again, any remaining results must be tails). Now we put all of these outcomes together with the sum rule. We conclude that in total, there are ( ( )) different combinations of heads and tails that Iswar might end up with. Notice that it was artificial to repeatedly break this example up into two cases at a time. Thus, Example serves as a good demonstration for a generalisation of the sum rule as we stated it above. It would have been more natural to have broken the problem of Iswar s coin flips up into four cases from the beginning, depending on whether he flips the coin zero, one, two, or three times. The total number of combinations of heads and tails that Iswar might end up with, is the sum of the combinations he can end up with in each of these cases; that is, . THEOREM (Sum Rule for many cases). Suppose that when you are determining the total number of outcomes, you can identify kdistinct cases with the property that every possible outcome lies in exactly one of the cases. If for each ibetween 1andkthere arenipossible outcomes in the ith case, then the total number of possible outcomes wil l be k i 1ni(that is, the sum as igoes from 1tokof theni). There is one other important way to use the sum rule. This application is a bit more subtle. Suppose you know the total number of outcomes, and you want to know the number of outcomes that don tinclude a particular event. The sum rule tells us that the
