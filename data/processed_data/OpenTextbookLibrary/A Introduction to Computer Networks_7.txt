It is not entirely clear, however, what would be considered a derivative work, beyond the traditional examples of abridgment and translation. Any supplemental materials like exams, labs, slides or coverage of additional topics would be new, independent works, and would require no permission. Even the inclusion in such supplements of modest amounts of material from this book would have a strong claim to Fair Use. In the open-source software world, the right to make derivative works is exercised whenever the software is modi ed, but it is hard to see how this applies to textbook supplements. The bottom line is that if you have a situation you re concerned about in this regard, let me know and I ll probably be happy to grant permission.
