basic instructions appear in just about every language: input: Get data from the keyboard, a le, the network, or some other device. output: Display data on the screen, save it in a le, send it over the network, etc. math: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication. conditional execution: Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code. Chapter . The way of the program repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation. Believe it or not, that s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look pretty much like these. So you can think of programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one of these basic instructions. Running Python One of the challenges of getting started with Python is that you might have to install Python and related software on your computer. If you are familiar with your operating system, and especially if you are comfortable with the command-line interface, you will have no trouble installing Python. But for beginners, it can be painful to learn about system administration and programming at the same time. To avoid that problem, I recommend that you start out running Python in a browser. Later, when you are comfortable with Python, I ll make suggestions for installing Python on your computer. There are a number of web pages you can use to run Python. If you already have a favorite, go ahead and use it. Otherwise I recommend Python Anywhere. I provide detailed instructions for getting started
