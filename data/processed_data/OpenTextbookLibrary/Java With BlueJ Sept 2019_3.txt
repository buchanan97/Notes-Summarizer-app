contributions to progra mming languages and environments . In 2010 Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and took over the development of the language. The language has gone through a number of updates, and at the time of writing the current release is referred to as Java . All programs in this text have been tested using Blue J running with Java . This text is about programming Java applications. The student may be interested in other Java technologies such as Java Card, Java TV, applets, etc.; for these we refer you to Oracle documentation (https: www.oracle.com technetwork java javase tech index.html ). The Java Compiler and the Java Virtual Machine When someone develops a Java program they must fi rst enter the Java code in a text file. Such files have names that end with .java and are known as source code files. In order to execute a Java program the program must first be translated into Java bytecode . We say source code files are human -readable but bytecode files are just s and s and are not human -readable. A program that performs this transation is called a compiler , and we say that the source code is compiled into bytecode. The compiler made available by Oracle is called javac. Bytecode fi les always have a name that ends with .class . The bytecode is not directly executable on a computer - bytecode is not machine code, but it is close to that. Bytecode is executed by a special program call the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM. Java programs are portable in the sense that you can write a program and deploy it anywhere - as long as there
