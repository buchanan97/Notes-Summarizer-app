support staff, etc., will have significant gaps in what they are able to accomplish. A basic understanding of hardware is important to any compute r professional. Learning assembly language is different than learning a HLL. Assembly language is intended to directly manipulate the hardware that a program is run on. It does not rely on the ability to abstract behavior, instead giving the ability to spe cify exactly how the hardware is to work to the programmer. Therefore it uses a very different vocabulary than a HLL. That vocabulary is not composed of statements, variables and numbers but of operations, instructions, addresses, and bits. In assembly it is important to remember that the actual hardware to be used only understands binary values and . To begin studying assembly, the reader must understand the basics of binary and how it is used in assembly language programming. The chapter is written to help the reader with the concepts of binary numbers. Chapter . Binary Number s Chapter . Values for Binary Numbers Many students will have had a class covering logic or Boolean algebra, where the binary values are generally true(T) and false(F), and use special symbols such as " " for AND and " " for OR. This INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING might be fine for mathematics and logic, but is hopelessly inadequate for the engineering task of creating computer machines and languages. To begin, the physical implementation of a binary value in a Central Proce ssing Unit's (CPU) hardware, called a bit , is implemented as a circuit called a flip-flop or latch. A flip -flop has a voltage of either volts or a positive voltage (most
