and chaos. Part III covers the simulation of systems with a large number of variables. After introducing the reader to the interactive simulation tool Py CX, it presents the modeling and analysis of complex systems (e.g., waves in excitable media, spread of epidemics and forest res) with cellular automata. It next discusses the modeling and analysis of continuous elds that are represented by partial differential equations. Examples are diffusion-reaction systems which can exhibit spontaneous self-organizing behavior (e.g., Turing pattern formation, Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction and Gray-Scott pattern formation). Part III concludes with the modeling and analysis of dynamical networks and agent-based models. The concepts of emergence and self-organization constitute the underlying thread that weaves the various chapters of the book together. About the Reviewer: Dr. Siddharth G. Chatterjee received his Bachelor s Degree in Technology (Honors) from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New Y ork, USA, all in Chemical Engineering. He has taught a variety of engineering and mathematical courses and his research interests are the areas of philosophy of science, mathematical modeling and simulation. Presently he is Associate Professor in the Department of Paper and Bioprocess Engineering at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Syracuse, v New Y ork. He is also a Fellow of the Institution of Engineers (India) and Member of the Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers. Sayama has produced a very comprehensive introduction and overview of complexity. Typically, these topics would occur in many different courses, as a side note or possible behavior of a particular type of mathematical model, but only after overcoming a huge hurdle of technical detail. Thus, initially, I saw this
