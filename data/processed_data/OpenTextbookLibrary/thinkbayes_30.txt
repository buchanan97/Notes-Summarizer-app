problem: class Cookie(Pmf): def init (self, hypos): Pmf. init (self) for hypo in hypos: self.Set(hypo, ) self.Normalize() A Co okie ob ject is a Pmf that maps from h yp otheses to their probabilities. The init metho d giv es eac h h yp othesis the same prior probabilit y . As in the previous section, there are t w o h yp otheses: hypos ' Bowl ' , ' Bowl ' pmf Cookie(hypos) Cookie pro vides an Update metho d that tak es data as a parameter and up dates the probabilities: Chapter . Computational Statistics def Update(self, data): for hypo in self.Values(): like self.Likelihood(data, hypo) self.Mult(hypo, like) self.Normalize() Update lo ops through eac h h yp othesis in the suite and m ultiplies its probabilit y b y the lik eliho o d of the data under the h yp othesis, whic h is computed b y Likelihood : mixes ' Bowl ' :dict(vanilla , chocolate ), ' Bowl ' :dict(vanilla , chocolate ), def Likelihood(self, data, hypo): mix self.mixes hypo like mix data return like Likelihood uses mixes , whic h is a dictionary that maps from the name of a b o wl to the mix of co okies in the b o wl. Here's what the up date lo oks lik e: pmf.Update( ' vanilla ' ) And then w e can prin t the p osterior probabilit y of eac h h yp othesis: for hypo, prob in pmf.Items(): print hypo, prob The result is Bowl Bowl whic h is the same as what w e got b efore. This co de is more complicated than what w e sa w in the previous
