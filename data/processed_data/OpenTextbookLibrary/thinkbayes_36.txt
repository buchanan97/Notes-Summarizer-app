Estimation Here's ho w Likelihood w orks. If hypo data , that means the roll is greater than the n um b er of sides on the die. That can't happ en, so the lik eliho o d is . Otherwise the question is, Giv en that there are hypo sides, what is the c hance of rolling data ? The answ er is hypo , regardless of data . Here is the statemen t that do es the up date (if I roll a ): suite.Update( ) And here is the p osterior distribution: After w e roll a , the probabilit y for the -sided die is . The most lik ely alternativ e is the -sided die, but there is still almost a c hance for the -sided die. What if w e roll a few more times and get , , , , , and ? for roll in , , , , , : suite.Update(roll) With this data the -sided die is eliminated, and the -sided die seems quite lik ely . Here are the results: No w the probabilit y is that w e are rolling the -sided die, and less than for the -sided die. The dice problem is based on an example I sa w in Sanjo y Maha jan's class on Ba y esian inference. Y ou can do wnload the co de in this section from http: thinkbayes.com dice.py .
