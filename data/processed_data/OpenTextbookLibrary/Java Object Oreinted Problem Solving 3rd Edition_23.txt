C language, in which object-oriented features were grafted onto the C language, Java was designed from scratch as an object-oriented language. Java is robust , meaning that errors in Java programs don t cause system crashes as often as errors in other programming languages. Certain features of the language enable many potential errors to be detected before a program is run. Java is platform independent . Aplatform , in this context, is just a particu- Platform independence lar kind of computer system, such as a Macintosh or Windows system. Java s trademark is Write once, run anywhere. This means that a Java program can be run without changes on different kinds of computers. This is not true for other high-level programming languages. This portability the ability to run on virtually any platform is one reason that Java is well suited for WWW applications. Java is a distributed language, which means that its programs can be designed to run on computer networks. In addition to the language itself, Java comes with an extensive collection of code libraries software that has been designed to be used directly for particular types of applications that make it particularly easy to build software systems for the Internet and the WWW. This is one of the reasons why Java is so well suited for supporting applications on corporate networks. Java is a secure language. Designed to be used on networks, Java contains features that protect against untrusted code code that might introduce a virus or corrupt your system in some way. For example, once they are downloaded into your browser, Web-based Java programs are prevented from reading and writing information from and to your desktop computer.
