performi ng before you pressed the key. Again, you should understand that this is a purely mechanica l process: A device signals an interrupt simply by turning on a wire. The CPU is built so that when that wire is turned on, the CPU saves enough information about what it is currently d oing so that it can return to the same state later. This information consists of the conte nts of important internal registers such as the program counter. Then the CPU jumps to some predet ermined memory location and begins executing the instructions stored there. Those i nstructions make up an interrupt handler thatdoestheprocessingnecessarytorespondtotheinterru pt. (Thisinterrupthandler is part of the device driver software for the device that sign aled the interrupt.) At the end of the interrupt handler is an instruction that tells the CPU to jump back to what it was doing; it does that by restoring its previously saved state. Interrupts allow the CPU to deal with asynchronous events . In the regular fetchand-execute cycle, things happen in a predetermined order; everything that happens is synchronized with everything else. Interrupts make it po ssible for the CPU to deal e ciently with events that happen asynchronously, that is, at unpre dictable times. As another example of how interrupts are used, consider what happens when the CPU needs to access data that is stored on a hard disk. The CPU can access data directly only if it is in main memory. Data on the disk has to be copied into memory be fore it can be accessed. Unfortunately, on the scale of speed at which the CPU operate s, the disk drive is extremely slow. When the
