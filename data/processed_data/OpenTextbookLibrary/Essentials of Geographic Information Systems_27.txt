types of reference maps include topographic maps such as those created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS; seehttp: topomaps.usgs.gov ) and image maps obtained from satellites or aircraft that are available through online mapping services.

For instance, local governments need accurate reference maps for land use, zoning, and tax purposes. National governments need accurate reference maps for political, infrastructure, an d military purposes. People who depend on navigation devices like global positioning system (GPS) units also need accurate and up -to-date reference maps in order to arrive at their desired destinations. Thematic Maps Contrasting the reference map are thematic maps. As the name suggests, thematic maps are concerned with a particular theme or topic of interest. While reference maps emphasize the location of geographic features, thematic maps are more concerned with how things are distributed across space . Such things are often abstract concepts such as life expectancy around the world, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in Europe, or literacy rates across India. One of the strengths of mapping, and in particular of thematic mapping, is that it can ma ke such abstract and invisible concepts visible and comparable on a map.

In other words, thematic maps often contain and
