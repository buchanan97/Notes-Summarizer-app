ridiculously liberal in what it allows. The idea behind this design was that it would make programming in Java Script easier for beginners. In actuality, it mostly makes finding problems in your programs harder because the system will not point them out to you. This flexibility also has its advantages, though. It leaves room for techniques that are impossible in more rigid languages and makes for a pleasant, informal style of programming. After learning the language properly and working with it for a while, I have come to actually like Java Script. There have been several versions of Java Script. ECMAScript version was the widely supported version during Java Script s ascent to dominance, roughly between 2000 and 2010. During this time, work was underway on an ambitious version , which planned a number of radical improvements and extensions to the language. Changing a living, widely used language in such a radical way turned out to be politically di icult, and work on version was abandoned in 2008. A much less ambitious version , which made only some uncontroversial improvements, came out in 2009. In 2015, version came out, a major update that included some of the ideas planned for version . Since then we ve had new, small updates every year. The fact that Java Script is evolving means that browsers have to constantly keep up. If you re using an older browser, it may not support every feature. The language designers are careful to not make any changes that could break existing programs, so new browsers can still run old programs. In this book, I m using the 2024 version of Java Script. Web browsers are not the
