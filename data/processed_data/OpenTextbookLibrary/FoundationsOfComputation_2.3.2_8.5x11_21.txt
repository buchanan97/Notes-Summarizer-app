is notequivalent to q r. CHAPTER . LOGIC AND PROOF q p r. The problem is that q p p rmeans (q p) (p r), so that ( p p) is not a subexpression. So even though in practice we won t al ways write all the parentheses, you always have to be aware of where the parenth eses belong. The nal piece of algebra in Boolean algebra is the observati on that we can chain logical equivalences together. That is, from P Qand Q R, it follows that P R. This is really just a consequence of the Second Substitutio n Law: The equivalence Q Rallows us to substitute Rfor Qin the statement P Q, giving P R. (Remember that, by De nition , logical equivalence is de ned in terms of a proposition.) This means that we can show that tw o compound propositions are logically equivalent by nding a chain of l ogical equivalences that lead from one to the other. For example: p (p q) p ( p q) de nition of p q, Theorem (p p) (p q) Distributive Law F (p q) Law of Contradiction, Theorem (p q) Identity Law Each step in the chain has its own justi cation. In several ca ses, a substitution law is used without stating as much. In the rst line, for exam ple, the de nition ofp qis thatp q p q. The Second Substitution Law allows us to substitute ( p q) for (p q). In the last line, we implicitly applied the First Substitution Law to the Identity Law, F p p, to obtain F (p q) (p q). The chain of equivalences in the
