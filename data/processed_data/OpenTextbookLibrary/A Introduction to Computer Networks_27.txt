the selection or tuning of algorithms that then make these route-selection choices automatically. As an example of the latter, the algorithms of Distance-Vector Routing-Update Algorithm build forwarding tables on their own, but those tables are greatly in uenced by the administrative assignment of link costs. With pure datagram forwarding, used at either the LAN or the IP layer, the path taken by a packet is determined solely by its destination, and traf c engineering is limited to the choices made between alternative paths. We have already, however, suggested that datagram forwarding can be extended to take quality-ofservice information into account; this may be used to have voice traf c with its relatively low bandwidth but intolerance for delay take an entirely different path than bulk le transfers. Alternatively, the network manager may simply assign voice traf c a higher priority, so it does not have to wait in queues behind le-transfer traf c. The quality-of-service information may be set by the end-user, in which case an ISP may wish to recognize it only for designated users, which in turn means that the ISP will implicitly use the traf c source when making routing decisions. Alternatively, the quality-of-service information may be set by the ISP itself, based on its best guess as to the application; this means that the ISP may be using packet size, port number ( Transport ) and other contents as part of the routing decision. For some explicit mechanisms supporting this kind of routing, see Routing on Other Attributes . At the LAN layer, traf c-engineering mechanisms are historically limited, though see Software-De ned Networking . At the IP layer, more strategies are available; see Quality of
