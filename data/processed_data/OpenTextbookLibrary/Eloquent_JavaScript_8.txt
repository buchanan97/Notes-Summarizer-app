a few more improvements. Most importantly, there is no need to specify the way we want the program to jump back and forth anymore the whileconstruct takes care of that. It continues executing the block (wrapped in braces) below it as long as the condition it was given holds. That condition is count , which means the count is less than or equal to . We no longer have to create a temporary value and compare that to zero, which was just an uninteresting detail. Part of the power of programming languages is that they can take care of uninteresting details for us. Attheendoftheprogram, afterthe whileconstructhasfinished, the console .logoperation is used to write out the result. Finally, here is what the program could look like if we happened to have the convenient operations rangeand sumavailable, which respectively create a collection of numbers within a range and compute the sum of a collection of numbers: console.log(sum(range( , ))); The moral of this story is that the same program can be expressed in both long and short, unreadable and readable ways. The first version of the program was extremely obscure, whereas this last one is almost English: logthesumof the rangeof numbers from to . (We will see in later chapters how to define operations like sumand range.) A good programming language helps the programmer by allowing them to talk about the actions that the computer has to perform on a higher level. It helps omit details, provides convenient building blocks (such as whileand console.log ), allows you to define your own building blocks (such as sumand range), and makes those blocks easy to compose.
