Write a paragraph that uses the results in this chapter to answer the question clearly, precisely, and honestly. Exercise In the repository you downloaded, you should nd a le named chap02ex.ipynb ; open it. Some cells are already lled in, and you should execute them. Other cells give you instructions for exercises. Follow the instructions and ll in the answers. A solution to this exercise is in chap02soln.ipynb In the repository you downloaded, you should nd a le named chap02ex.py ; you can use this le as a starting place for the following exercises. My solution is inchap02soln.py . Exercise The mode of a distribution is the most frequent value; see http: wikipedia.org wiki Mode (statistics) . Write a function called Mode that takes a Hist and returns the most frequent value. As a more challenging exercise, write a function called All Modes that returns a list of value-frequency pairs in descending order of frequency. Exercise Using the variable totalwgt lb , investigate whether rst babies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohen's dto quantify the di erence between the groups. How does it compare to the di erence in pregnancy length? Glossary distribution : The values that appear in a sample and the frequency of each. histogram : A mapping
