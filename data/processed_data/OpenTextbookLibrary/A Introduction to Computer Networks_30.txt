that queue is full, packets will be dropped . The most common strategy (though not the only one) is to drop any packets that arrive when the queue is full. The term congestion may refer either to the point where the queue is just beginning to build up, or to the point where the queue is full and packets are lost. In their paper CJ89 , Chiu and Jain refer to the rst point as the knee ; this is where the slope of the load vs throughput graph attens. They refer to the second point as the cliff; this is where packet losses may lead to a precipitous decline in throughput. Other authors use the term contention for knee-congestion. In the Internet, most packet losses are due to congestion. This is not because congestion is especially bad (though it can be, at times), but rather that other types of losses ( egdue to packet corruption) are insigni cant by comparison. When to Upgrade? Deciding when a network really does have insuf cient bandwidth is not a technical issue but an economic one. The number of customers may increase, the cost of bandwidth may decrease or customers may simply be willing to pay more to have data transfers complete in less time; customers here can be external or in-house. Monitoring of links and routers for congestion can, however, help determine exactly what parts of the network would most bene t from upgrade. We emphasize that the presence of congestion does notmean that a network has a shortage of bandwidth. Bulk-traf c senders (though not real-time senders) attempt to send as fast as possible, and congestion is simply the network s
