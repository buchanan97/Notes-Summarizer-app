Distributions pooled var (n1 var1 n2 var2) (n1 n2) d diff math.sqrt(pooled var) return d In this example, the di erence in means is standard deviations, which is small. To put that in perspective, the di erence in height between men and women is about standard deviations (see https: en.wikipedia. org wiki Effect size ). Reporting results We have seen several ways to describe the di erence in pregnancy length (if there is one) between rst babies and others. How should we report these results? The answer depends on who is asking the question. A scientist might be interested in any (real) e ect, no matter how small. A doctor might only care about e ects that are clinically signi cant ; that is, di erences that a ect treatment decisions. A pregnant woman might be interested in results that are relevant to her, like the probability of delivering early or late. How you report results also depends on your goals. If you are trying to demonstrate the importance of an e ect, you might choose summary statistics that emphasize di erences. If you are trying to reassure a patient, you might choose statistics that put the di erences in context. Of course your decisions should also be guided by professional ethics. It's ok to be persuasive; you should design statistical reports and visualizations that tell a story clearly. But you should also do your best to make your reports honest, and to acknowledge uncertainty and limitations.
