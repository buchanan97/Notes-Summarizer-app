available on more recent PC's with bit addressing, though that limit has been moved with the advent of bit computers. The names for the various values of 2n are given in the following table. Kilo Giga Penta The old joke is that there are types of people in the world, those who know binary and those who do not. INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING Mega Tera Exa Table - : Names for values of 2n, n , , , , , Chapter . Converting Binary , Decimal , and Hex Numbers Chapter . Converting Binary to Decimal Computers think in 's and 's, and when dealing with the internal workings of a computer humans must adjust to the computers mindset. However when the computer produces answers, the humans that use them like to think in decimal. So it is often necessary for programmers to be able to convert between what the computer wa nts to see (binary), and what the human end users want to see (decimal). These next sections will deal with how to convert binary to decimal, and then give ways to convert decimal to binary. Finally it will give a section on a useful representation f or handling large binary numbers called hexadecimal. To convert binary to decimal, it is only necessary to remember that each or in a binary number represents the amount of that binary power of . For each binary power of , you have either or ins tance of that number. To see this, consider the binary number 1001010 . This number has . This can be generalized into an easy way to do this conversion. To convert from b inary
