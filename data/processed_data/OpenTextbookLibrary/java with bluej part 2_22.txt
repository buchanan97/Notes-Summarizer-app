; j ) System . out. print (m i j " t"); System . out. println (); Higher Dimensions You can de ne and use arrays with any number of dimensions. For instance suppose we are recording values for each second of each minute of each hour in a day, we could use a -dimensional array such as: double obs new double ; Of course the storage structure used in this case would involve an array of elements, where each of those is an array of elements and where each of those is an array of elements. . EXERCISES Exercises . Write a program that displays the names of the months for the year 2005 when the snowfall in Denver exceeded inch. . Write a program that displays the name of the month in the year 2005 when Denver received the greatest amount of snow. . Write a program that calculates and displays the total number of kilometres driven by each driver. . Write a program that calculates and displays the total number of kilometres driven (totalled over all drivers). . Write a program that displays each driver's name and the total number of kilometres driven. As well as the two dimensional array trips , your program must include a one dimensional array containing driver names. . Modify the program in Example so that it forms the product of A and B. If A has n rows and m columns and B has m rows and p columns, then the product A Byields a third matrix of n rows and p columns. Each element of C is a sum of products involving the ith row of A and the jthcolumn
