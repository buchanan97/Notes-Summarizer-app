most dogs likely hear is, blah blah blah walk blah blah blah blah. That is because walk is a reserved word in dog language. Many might suggest that the langua ge between humans and cats has no reserved words1. The reserved words in the language where humans talk to Python include the following: False await else import pass None break except in raise True class finally is return and continue for lambda try as def from nonlocal while assert del global not with async elif if or yield That is it, and unlike a dog, Python is already completely trained. When you say try , Python will try every time you say it without fail. We will learn these reserved words and how they are used in good time, but for now we will focus on the Python equivalent of speak (in human-to-dog language) . The nice thing about telling Python to speak is that we can even tell it what to say by giving it a message in quotes: 1http: xkcd.com CHAPTER . WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN TO WRITE PROGRAMS? print( quotesingle.ts1 Hello world! quotesingle.ts1 ) And we have even written our rst syntactically correct Python sentence. Our sentence starts with the function print followed by a string of text of our choosing enclosed in single quotes. The strings in the print statements are enclosed in quo tes. Single quotes and double quotes do the same thing; most people use single quotes except in cases where a single quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string. Conversing with Python Now that we have a word and a simple sentence that we know in Python, we need to
