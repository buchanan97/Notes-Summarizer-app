a progressive step-by-step development concepts through recurrent examples that capture the essence of a problem. The described solutions might not necessarily be the best, however they are easy to comprehend and widely used in the community. For example, odometry and line-fitting are used to explain forward kinematics and least-squares solutions, respectively, and later serve as motivating examples for error prop15 Contents agation and the Kalman filter in a localization context. Notably, the book is explicitly robot-agnostic, reflecting the timeliness of fundamental concepts. Rather, a series of possible project-based curricula are described in an Appendix and available online, ranging from a maze-solving competition that can be realized with most camera-equipped differential-wheel robots to manipulation experiments with a robotic arm, all of which can be entirely conducted in simulation to teach most of the core concepts. After multiple years of development and distribution mainly via Github, this new edition of the book has been co-authored by my colleagues in the Computer Science department, Bradley Hayes, Christoffer Heckman, and Alessandro Roncone, each having thaught multiple iterations of our Introduction to Robotics and Advanced Robotics courses as well as special topics courses that pertain to their sub-fields of robotics research. They are adding not only tremendous technical depth, but also years of experience on how certain subjects should be taught to remain engaging and exciting.
