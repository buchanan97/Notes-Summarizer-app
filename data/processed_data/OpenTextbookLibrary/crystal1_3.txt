get a rough assessment of their performance. Let s say we choose three things: the number of research papers the professor publishes each year, the total amount of research funding they ve been granted, and the average student evaluation score of the courses they teach. That seems like a good first cut at assessing faculty performance. We then go on our merry data science way, finding correlations, making data visualizations, and drawing conclusions. This is all fine and dandy, provided we always keep in mind that it was those three qualities, andonlythose three, that we gathered in the first place. If our study gains any traction, and university professors find they have a vested interest in being ranked high in our yearly study, we ll discover that they act to maximizeonlythe categories that are being collected. We didn t gather data on how many university committees they served on, or how many independent studies they supervised, or how many advisees they had,etc. CHAPTER . INTRODUCTION Those metrics will inevitably become minimized in importance, because they weren t part of what we lifted out of the real world and onto the bottom rung of our lofty chain. The moral is: what we measure matters, often more than we realize. Our country s GDP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are easy things to quantify, and so we often do. And thus they gain great importance in analyses of the economy. But are they actually the most important indicators? Does focusing on them leave out other, perhaps more vital, benchmarks? I ll just leave you with that question for now. Data Have you ever gotten blood work done, say for an annual
