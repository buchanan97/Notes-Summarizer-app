might seem peculiar, but there is a method to my whitespace. After each puzzle, I leave enough space that t he hint appears on the next sheet of paper and the solution on the next sheet af ter that. When I use this book in my class, I hand it out a few pages at a time, an d students collect them in a binder. My pagination system makes it possi ble to hand out a problem without giving away the hint or the solution. Somet imes I fold and staple the hint and hand it out along with the problem so that s tudents can decide whether and when to look at the hint. If you print the bo ok single-sided, you can discard the blank pages and the system still works.
