as the value of p. Similarly, in the case where pis false, ( p) is also false. Organized into a truth table, this argument t akes the rather simple form p p ( p) truefalsetrue falsetruefalse In ordinary algebra, it s easy to be confused by the equals sign, because i t has two very di erent roles. In an identity such as the distributive law, it means is always equal to. On the other hand, an equation such as x2 3x is a statement that might or might not be true, depending on the value of x. Boolean algebra has two operators, and , that play roles similar to the two roles of the equals sign. It is also an example of a more general fact known as duality, which asserts that given any tautology that uses only the operators , , and , another tautology can be obtained from it by interchanging with and Twith F. We won t attempt to prove this here. CHAPTER .
