are compiled into machine language, but it is a machine language for a computer that doesn t really exist. This so-called virtua l computer is known as the Java Virtual Machine , or JVM. The machine language for the Java Virtual Machine is called Java bytecode . There is no reason why Java bytecode couldn t be used as the m achine language of a real computer, rather than a virtual computer. But in fact th e use of a virtual machine makes possible one of the main selling points of Java: the fact that it can actually be used on any computer. All that the computer needs is an interpreter for J ava bytecode. Such an interpreter simulates the JVM in the same way that a C64 emulator simulate s a Commodore computer. (The term JVM is also used for the Java bytecode interpreter p rogram that does the simulation, so we say that a computer needs a JVM in order to run Java progra ms. Technically, it would be more correct to say that the interpreter implements the JVM than to say that it isa JVM.) CHAPTER . THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE Of course, a di erent Java bytecode interpreter is needed fo r each type of computer, but once a computer has a Java bytecode interpreter, it can run an y Java bytecode program, and the same program can be run on any computer that has such an int erpreter. This is one of the essential features of Java: the same compiled program can be run on many di erent types of computers.
