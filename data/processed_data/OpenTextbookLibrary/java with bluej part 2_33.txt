An instance of String Builder is created using constructors. We show three ways to instantiate an instance of String Builder : a String Builder instance has an initial space allotment . that space can grow larger as necessary . If no arguments space for characters String Builder sb1 new String Builder (); If a string is provided space for that string plus String Builder sb2 new String Builder (" Good "); If a number is provided space for the size specified String Builder sb3 new String Builder ( ); Some String Builder methods are listed in the next table. Note many of these are the same or similar to those of the String class; the last ve methods listed starting with append are not de ned for String . Following the table we give an example using String Builder to build up a string through catenation. With String Builder we cannot use the catenation operator (" "), instead we use the append method. CHAPTER . VALIDATION AND TEXT MANIPULATION Useful String Builder methods method name type description char At( ) char returns the character at a speci ed position length() int returns the length of a string index Of( ) int determines where a string starts substring( ) String returns a substring append( ) String appends a string to the current string insert( ) String inserts a string delete() String removes a string replace() String replaces a substring reverse() String the instance is replaced by its reverse Table : Some of the useful String Builder methods . MANIPULATING TEXT Example . Catenating strings This example reads the le Readme.txt token-by-token catenating each token to the next. The append method is
