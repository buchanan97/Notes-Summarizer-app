from values to frequencies, or a graph that shows this mapping. Chapter . Distributions frequency : The number of times a value appears in a sample. mode : The most frequent value in a sample, or one of the most frequent values. normal distribution : An idealization of a bell-shaped distribution; also known as a Gaussian distribution. uniform distribution : A distribution in which all values have the same frequency. tail: The part of a distribution at the high and low extremes. central tendency : A characteristic of a sample or population; intuitively, it is an average or typical value. outlier : A value far from the central tendency. spread : A measure of how spread out the values in a distribution are. summary statistic : A statistic that quanti es some aspect of a distribution, like central tendency or spread. variance : A summary statistic often used to quantify spread. standard deviation : The square root of variance, also used as a measure of spread. e ect size : A summary statistic intended to quantify the size of an e ect like a di erence between groups. clinically signi cant : A result, like a di erence between groups, that is relevant in practice. Chapter Probability mass functions The code for this chapter is in probability.py . For information about downloading and working with this code, see Section . Pmfs Another way to represent a distribution is a probability mass function (PMF), which maps from each value to its probability. A probability is a frequency expressed as a fraction of the sample size, n. To get from frequencies to probabilities, we divide through by n, which is called normalization
