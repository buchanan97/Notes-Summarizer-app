to the positions and orientations (rotations around the primary axes ( x,y, and z) that the end-effector can reach. Each actuated joint will typically add a degree of freedom, unless it is redundant (moving in the same direction, with the same physical effect, as a different joint). Figures and show a series of manipulators operating on a planar surface. In such a scenario, the degrees of freedom of the end-effector are limited to moving up and down, sideways, and rotating . Degrees of freedom around their pivot point. As a plane only has those three degrees of freedom, adding additional joints will not increase the number of Cartesian Do Fs unless they allow the robot to also move in and out of the plane ( vertical axis). An exact definition of the number of degrees of freedom is tricky and requires deriving analytical expressions for the end-effector position and orientation, which will be the subject of Chapter . xy z Figure . From left to right: Manipulators with one, two, three and four mechanical Do Fs. The Cartesian Do Fs needed for the end-effector to move in a plane are: the vertical displacement of the end-effector with respect to the base, its horizontal displacement, and its orientation. xy z Figure . From left to right: Manipulators with one, two, three, and four Do Fs using a combination of rotational and prismatic joints. Choosing the right kinematics involves a very complex trade-off between mechanical complexity, maneuverability, achievable precision, cost, and ease of control. The very popular differential-wheel drive consisting of two independently controlled wheels that share a common axis, such as those mounted on a robotic vacuum cleaner is cheap, highly
