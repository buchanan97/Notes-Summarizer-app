The mechanisms that might achieve these feats could be drastically different in terms of energy consumption, kinematics, stability, and other capabilities required by the robot that implements them. Furthermore, the above definitions are loose and ambiguous: for example, swimming can be performed using many different forms of propulsion. Similarly, a sliding motion on the ground might work well for swimming too with only few modifications. The way in which the individual parts of a robot can move with respect to each other and the environment is called the kinematics of the robot. Kinematics (which will be discussed in detail in Chapter ) are only concerned with the position and speed (first derivative of position) of those parts; depending on the application, one may want to use a deeper level of abstraction called dynamics , which is concerned with quantities such as acceleration (second derivative of position) and jerk (third derivative of position). Commercially, the most widespread form of locomotion is rolling. This is partially due to the fact that rolling provides by far the most efficient energy to speed ratio (see Figure ), making the invention of the wheel one of the greatest technological breakthroughs in history. It also is a widely implemented form of locomotion, e.g. with cars and bicycles. Consequently, humans have modified their environment to have as many smooth surfaces as possible e.g. roads, warehouses, and residential floors. In contrast, evolution has not equipped any animal with wheel-like actuators because of their poor performance in natural environments such as an unmown meadow, a forest floor, a
