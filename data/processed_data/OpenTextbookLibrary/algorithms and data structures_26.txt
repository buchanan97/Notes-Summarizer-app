kinds of data, such as geometric data in two- and three-dimensional space, or real-valued functions of one or two real variables, there are natural mappings that we learned in school. These help us greatly in getting a feel for the data. .Multidimensional data (dimension ) can be displayed on a two-dimensional screen using a number of straight forward techniques, such as projections into a subspace, or using color or gray level as a fourth dimension. But our power of perception diminishes rapidly with increasing dimensionality. .For discrete combinatorial data there is often no natural or accepted visual representation. As an example, we often draw a graph by mapping nodes into points and edges into lines. This representation is natural for graphs that are embedded in Euclidean space, such as a road network, and we can readily make sense of a map with thousands of cities and road links. When we extend it to arbitrary graphs by placing a node anywhere on the screen, on the other hand, we get a random crisscrossing of lines of little intuitive value. In addition to such inherent problems of visual representation, practical difficulties of the most varied type abound. Examples: Some screens are awfully small, and some data sets are awfully large for display even on the largest screens. An animation has to run within a narrow speed range. If it is too fast, we fail to follow, or the screen may flicker disturbingly; if too slow, we may lack the time to observe it.
