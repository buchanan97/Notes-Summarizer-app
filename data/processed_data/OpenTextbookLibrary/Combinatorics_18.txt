we can think of the aspects that can change as being the variety of coffee, and the size. There are four outcomes (choices) for the first aspect, and three outcomes (choices) for the second aspect, so the total number of possible outcomes is . Sometimes it seems clear that there are more than two aspects that are varying. If this happens, we can apply the product rule more than once to determine the answer, by first identifying two aspects (one of which may be all the rest ), and then subdividing one or both of those aspects. An example of this is the problem posed earlier of buying a doughnut to go with your coffee. EXAMPLE . Kyle wants to buy coffee and a doughnut. The local doughnut shop has five kinds of doughnuts for sale, and sells four varieties of coffee in three sizes (as in Example ). How many different orders could Kyle make? SOLUTION. A natural way to divide Kyle s options into two aspects that can vary, is to consider separately their choice of doughnut, and their choice of coffee. There are five choices for the kind of doughnut they order, so n1 . For choosing the coffee, we have already used the product rule in Example to determine that the number of coffee options is n2 . Thus the total number of different orders Kyle could make is n1n2 . Let s go through an example that more clearly involves repeated applications of the product rule. EXAMPLE . Chlo wants to manufacture children s t-shirts. There are generally three sizes of t-shirts for children: small, medium, and large. She wants to offer the t-shirts in
