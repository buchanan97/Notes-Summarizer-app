Chapter . Exploratory data analysis respondent : A person who responds to a survey. sample : The subset of a population used to collect data. representative : A sample is representative if every member of the population has the same chance of being in the sample. oversampling : The technique of increasing the representation of a sub-population in order to avoid errors due to small sample sizes. raw data : Values collected and recorded with little or no checking, calculation or interpretation. recode : A value that is generated by calculation and other logic applied to raw data. data cleaning : Processes that include validating data, identifying errors, translating between data types and representations, etc. Chapter Distributions Histograms One of the best ways to describe a variable is to report the values that appear in the dataset and how many times each value appears. This description is called the distribution of the variable. The most common representation of a distribution is a histogram , which is a graph that shows the frequency of each value. In this context, frequency" means the number of times the value appears. In Python, an e cient way to compute frequencies is with a dictionary. Given a sequence of values, t: hist for x in t: hist x hist.get(x, ) The result is a dictionary that maps from values to frequencies. Alternatively, you could use the Counter class de ned in the collections module: from collections import Counter counter Counter(t) The result is a Counter object, which is a subclass of dictionary. Chapter . Distributions Another option is to use the pandas method value counts , which we saw in the previous chapter. But for
