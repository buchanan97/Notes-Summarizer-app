will recommend that you take a course in electricity. It is indeed the case that the experiment that you have seen done, like any experiment in physics, involves two parts. In the first place it consists in the observation of certain facts In the second place, it consists in the interpretation of those facts The result of the operations in which an experimental physicist is engaged is by no means the perception of a group of concrete facts; it is the formation of a judgement interrelating certain abstract and symbolic ideas which theories alone correlate with the facts really observed (Duhem 1914). A consequence of this is that the reports are conjectural, or fallible. Any of them may be mistaken. They are not a bedrock. Second, any collection of data is a selection among what it is possible to observe or measure. The philosopher of science Karl Popper writes: the belief that we can start with pure observation alone, without anything in the nature of a theory is absurd; as may be illustrated by the story of the man who dedicated his life to natural science, wrote down everything he could observe, and bequeathed his priceless collection of observations to the Royal Society to be used as evidence. This story should show us that though beetles may profitably be collected, observations may not. Twenty-five years ago I tried to bring home the same point to a group of physics students in Vienna by beginning a lecture with the following instructions: 'Take pencil and paper; carefully observe, and write down what you have observed!' They asked, of course, what I wanted them to observe. Clearly the instruction, 'Observe!' is absurd. (It
