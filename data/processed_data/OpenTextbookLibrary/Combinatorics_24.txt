end up with, if we aren t keeping track of the order of the outcomes? (By not keeping track of the order of the outcomes, I mean that we ll consider flipping two heads followed by one tails as being the same as flipping two heads and one tails in any other order.) . Basic Counting Techniques SOLUTION. To answer this question, we ll break the problem into cases. First we ll divide the problem into two possibilities: Iswar flips the coin no times; or he flips it at least once. If Iswar does not flip the coin, there is only one possible outcome (no heads and no tails). If Iswar flips the coin at least once, then he flips it between one and three times. We ll have to break this down further to find how many outcomes are involved. We break the case where Iswar flips the coin between one and three times down into two cases: he might flip it exactly once, or he might flip it more than once. If he flips it exactly once, the outcome of that might be heads or tails, so there are two possible outcomes. If he flips it more than once, again we ll need to further subdivide this case. The case where Iswar flips the coin either two or three times naturally breaks down into two cases: he might flip it twice, or he might flip it three times. If he flips it twice, the number of heads he gets might be zero, one, or two, so there are three possible outcomes (the remaining results, if any, must all be tails). If he flips it three times, the number
