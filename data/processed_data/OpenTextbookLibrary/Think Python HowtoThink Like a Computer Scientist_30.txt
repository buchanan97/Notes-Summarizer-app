for copies? . If I leave my house at : am and run mile at an easy pace ( : per mile), then miles at tempo ( : per mile) and mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast? Chapter . Variables, expressions and statements Chapter Functions In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you de ne a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can call the function by name. Function calls We have already seen one example of a function call : type( ) class 'int' The name of the function is type . The expression in parentheses is called the argument of the function. The result, for this function, is the type of the argument. It is common to say that a function takes an argument and returns a result. The result is also called the return value . Python provides functions that convert values from one type to another. The intfunction takes any value and converts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise: int( ' ') int( 'Hello ') Value Error: invalid literal for int(): Hello intcan convert oating-point values to integers, but it doesn t round off; it chops off the fraction part: int( ) int(- ) - float converts integers and strings to oating-point numbers: float( ) float( ' ') Chapter . Functions Finally, strconverts its argument to a string: str( ) ' ' str( ) ' ' Math functions Python has a math module that provides most of the familiar mathematical functions. A module is a le that contains
