Chapter . Overflow of Integer Addition Because integers have fixed sizes, addition and subtraction can cause a problem known as intege r overflow . This happens which the two numbers which are being added are large positive or negative values, and the combining of the values results in numbers too big to be store in the integer value. For example, a bit integer can store values from - . So when 0100 ( ) 0101 ( ) 1001 (- ) are added using bit integers the result is too large to store in the integer. When this happens, the number changes sign and gives the wrong answer, as the foll owing figure shows. INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING Figure - : Addition with overflow Attempting to algorithmically figure out if overflow occur is difficult. First if one number is positive and the other is negative, overflow never occ urs. If both numbers are positive or negative, then if the sign of the sum is different than the sign of either of the inputs overflow has occurred. There is a much easier way to figure out if overflow has occurred. If the carry in bit to the last digit is the same as the carry out bit, then no overflow has occurred. If they are different, then overflow has occurre d. In figure the carry in and carry out for the last bit are both , so there is no overflow. Likewise, in figure the carry in and carry out are both , so there was no overflow. In figure the carry in is and the carry out is , so overflow has occurred. This method also works for
