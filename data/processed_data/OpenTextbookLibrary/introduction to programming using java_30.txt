structure: loops, which allow a sequence of instructions to be repeated over and over, and branches , which allow the computer to decide between two or more di erent courses of action by testing conditions tha t occur as the program is running. For example, it might be that if the value of the variable pri ncipal is greater than 10000, then the interest should be computed by multiplying the pr incipal by ; if not, then the interest should be computed by multiplying the principal by . A program needs some way of expressing this type of decision. In Java, it could be e xpressed using the following if statement : if (principal 10000) interest principal ; else interest principal ; (Don t worry about the details for now. Just remember that th e computer can test a condition and decide what to do next on the basis of that test.) Loops are used when the same task has to be performed more than once. For example, if you want to print out a mailing label for each name on a maili ng list, you might say, Get the rst name and address and print the label; get the second n ame and address and print the label; get the third name and address and print the label But this quickly becomes ridiculous and might not work at all if you don t know in adva nce how many names there are. What you would like to say is something like While there are m ore names to process, get the next name and address, and print the label. A loop can be used in a program to express
