moral support from my family. I would like to acknowledge the contributions of the publishing team, especially developmental editor Jill Batistick and Product Manager Alyssa Pratt. I am also grateful to my students for doing their own fair share of teaching. I particularly appreciate the often extensive comments I received from the following individuals, each of whom reviewed one or more chapters: Dan Cosley, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities; Allen Downey, Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering; Michael Goldweber, Xavier University; Ramesh Karne, Towson University; G. Manimaran, Iowa State University; Alexander Manov, Illinois Institute of Technology; Peter Reiher, University of California, Los Angeles; Rich Salz, Data Power Technology; Dave Schulz, Wisconsin Lutheran College; Sanjeev Setia, George Mason University; and Jon Weissman, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

I would like to thank all of them, even those I've managed to lose track of, to whom I also apologize. Those I can thank by name are Joel Adams, Michael Brackney, Jack Briner, Justin Delegard, Ben Follis, Min Chan Kim, Finn Kuusisto, Matt Lindner, Milo Martin, Gabe Schmidt, Fritz Sieker, and Alex Wauck. Since the initial release of the revised edition, user suggestions have continued to drive most of the progress. The github issue tracker and pull requests show the history of these valuable contributions. xx PREFACE Chapter Introduction Chapter Overview This book covers a lot of ground.
