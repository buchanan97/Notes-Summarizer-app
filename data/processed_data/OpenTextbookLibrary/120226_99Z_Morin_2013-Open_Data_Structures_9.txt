add (x) enqueue (x) remove () dequeue () Figure : A FIFO Queue . The Queue ,Stack , and Deque Interfaces The Queue interface represents a collection of elements to which we can add elements and remove the next element. More precisely, the operations supported by the Queue interface are add(x): add the value xto the Queue remove (): remove the next (previously added) value, y, from the Queue and return y Notice that the remove () operation takes no argument. The Queue squeueing discipline decides which element should be removed. There are many possible queueing disciplines, the most common of which include FIFO, priority, and LIFO. AFIFO ( rst-in- rst-out) Queue , which is illustrated in Figure , removes items in the same order they were added, much in the same way a queue (or line-up) works when checking out at a cash register in a grocery store. This is the most common kind of Queue so the quali er FIFO is often omitted. In other texts, the add(x) and remove () operations on a FIFO Queue are often called enqueue (x) and dequeue (), respectively. Apriority Queue , illustrated in Figure , always removes the smallest element from the Queue , breaking ties arbitrarily. This is similar to the way in which patients are triaged in a hospital emergency room. As patients arrive they are evaluated and then placed in a waiting room. When a doctor becomes available he or she rst treats the patient with the most life-threatening condition. The remove (x) operation on a priority Queue is usually called delete Min () in other texts. A very common queueing discipline is the LIFO (last-in- rst-out) discipline,
