gradual shift in these criteria. The axes of scienti c models I have described classical models as based on physical laws, expressed in the form of equations, and solved by mathematical analysis; conversely, models of complex systems are often based on simple rules and implemented as computations. We can think of this trend as a shift over time along two axes: Equation-based !simulation-based Analysis!computation Complexity science is di erent in several other ways. I present them here so you know what's coming, but some of them might not make sense until you have seen the examples later in the book. The axes of scienti c models Continuous!discrete Classical models tend to be based on continuous mathematics, like calculus; models of complex systems are often based on discrete mathematics, including graphs and cellular automatons. Linear!nonlinear Classical models are often linear, or use linear approximations to nonlinear systems; complexity science is more friendly to nonlinear models. Deterministic!stochastic Classical models are usually deterministic, which may re ect underlying philosophical determinism, discussed in Chapter ; complex models often include randomness. Abstract!detailed In classical models, planets are point masses, planes are frictionless, and cows are spherical (see http: thinkcomplex.com cow). Simpli cations like these are often necessary for analysis, but computational models can be more realistic. One, two!many Classical models are often limited to small numbers of components. For example, in celestial mechanics the two-body problem can be solved analytically; the three-body problem cannot. Complexity science often works with large numbers of components and larger number of interactions. Homogeneous!heterogeneous In classical models, the components and interactions tend to be identical; complex models more often include heterogeneity. These are generalizations, so we should not take them
