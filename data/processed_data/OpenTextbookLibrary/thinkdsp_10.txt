signals are de ned for all values of t, from negative in nity to in nity. You can't do much with a Signal until you evaluate it. In this context, evaluate" means taking a sequence of points in time, ts, and computing the corresponding values of the signal, ys. I represent tsandysusing Num Py arrays and encapsulate them in an object called a Wave. A Wave represents a signal evaluated at a sequence of points in time. Each point in time is called a frame (a term borrowed from movies and video). The measurement itself is called a sample , although frame" and sample" are sometimes used interchangeably. Signal provides make wave , which returns a new Wave object: wave mix.make wave(duration , start , framerate 11025) The plural of spectrum" is often written spectra", but I prefer to use standard English plurals. If you are familiar with spectra", I hope my choice doesn't sound too strange. Chapter . Sounds and signals Time (s) Figure : Segment from a mixture of two sinusoid signals. duration is the length of the Wave in seconds. start is the start time, also in seconds. framerate is the (integer) number of frames per second, which is also the number of samples per second. , frames per second is one of several framerates commonly used in audio le formats, including Waveform Audio File (WAV) and mp3. This example evaluates the signal from t 0tot at , equally-spaced frames (because , is half of , ). The time between frames, or timestep , is1 11025 seconds, about s. Wave provides a plot method that uses pyplot . You can plot the wave like this: wave.plot() pyplot.show()
