combine geographical reference information, and conversely, reference Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org books Saylor.org maps may contain thematic information. What is more, when used in conjunction, thematic and reference maps often complement each other. For example, public health officials in a city may be interested in providing equal access to emergency rooms to the city s residents. Insights into this and related questio ns can be obtained through visual comparisons of a reference map that shows the locations of emergency rooms across the city to thematic maps of various segments of the population (e.g., households below poverty, percent elderly, underrepresented groups). Within the context of a GIS, we can overlay the reference map of emergency rooms directly on top of the population maps to see whether or not access is uniform across neighborhood types. Clearly, there are other factors to consider when looking at emergenc y room access (e.g., access to transport), but through such map overlays, underserved neighborhoods can be identified. Figure Map Overlay Process Saylor URL: http: www.saylor.org books Saylor.org When presented in hardcopy format, both reference and thematic maps are static or fixed representations of reality. Such permanence on the page suggests that geography and the things that we map are also in many ways fixed or constant. This is far from reality. The integration of GISs with other forms of information technology like the Internet and mobile te lecommunications is rapidly changing this view of maps and mapping, as well as geography at large. Dynamic Maps The diffusion of GISs and the popularity of online mapping tools and applications speak to this shift in thinking about maps and map use. In this regard, it is worthwhile to
