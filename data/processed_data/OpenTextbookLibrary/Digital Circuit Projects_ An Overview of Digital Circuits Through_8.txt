way justifies the exorbitant prices that are charged, and the resultant extravagant lengths people go to in order to avoid paying those prices. It all plays into a hyper -materialistic capitalism that can only eventually fail as it pits consumers against producers, and ignores the overall societal good. I hope by releasing free books (or books with nominal costs) that we can start to have a discussion about the re lative merits of this type of unfettered capitalism, and perhaps come up with better, more sustainable market based economic models. The larger problem with high priced textbooks is the cost alone becomes an impediment to many people who wish to learn the material. Social good is advanced when information can be easily disseminated, shared, and discussed. I view providing this book for free as my contribution to those who want to learn this material. The second reason for this text is to provide a way t o incorporate labs into classes in Computer Organization, particularly online classes. As many colleges and universities moving more classes online, there is a need to translate beneficial methodologies from face- to-face environments to formats where they are useful in an online environment. One such instructional methodology that is hard to translate is laboratory experiences. A class in Computer Organization benefits immensely from labs that allow the students to create physical circuits. Labs provide reinforcement for the material covered in class, and the labs represent a fun and exciting way for students to interact with this material. This text is meant to provide a way to incorporate labs into any class on Computer Organization, but especially on line classes. Finally, this text book is written
