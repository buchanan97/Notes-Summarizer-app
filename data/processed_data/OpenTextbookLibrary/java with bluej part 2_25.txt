However there are cases where we can get a result we consider to be inappropriate. For example, suppose we use this method in a situation where we are calculating ages of employees. In this situation we expect someone's age to be positive - a non-positive age indicates something . TESTING AND THE ASSERT STATEMENT is wrong with our logic or with our data. In the program Calculate Age below we include an assert statement to trap the case where the calculated age is not positive (we have used the birth date 2090- - ). The result of executing this code is shown after the program listing. Note that the program has been terminated with an Assertion error.
