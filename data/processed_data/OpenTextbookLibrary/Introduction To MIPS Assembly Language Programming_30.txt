addition of negative numbers. Consider adding 1100 (- ) and 1011 (- ) 0111 ( ), shown in figure . Here the carry in is and the carry out is , so once again overflow has occur red. Figure - : Subtraction with overflow Chapter . Integer multiplication using bit shift operatio ns Multiplication and division of data values or variables involves hardware components in the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). In assembly these operations will be provided by the various INTRODUCTION TO MIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE P ROGRAMMING forms mul and div operators, and the hardware to implement them is beyond the scope of this book and will not be covered. However, what is of interest in writing assembly is multiplication and division by a constant. The reason multiplication and division by a constant is covered is that these operations can be provided by bit shift operations, and the bit shift operations are often faster to run than the equivalent mul or div operation. Therefore, bit shift operation s are often used in assembly to do multiplication and division, and therefore it is important for assembly language programmers to understand how this works. First consider multiplication of a number by a power of in base . In base , if a number is multiplied by a power of (10n, where n is the power of ), it is sufficient to move the number n places to the right filling in with 's. For example, 1000 (or ) , . This same concept holds in binary. To multiply a binary number ( e.g. , or 0000 1111 ) by , the number is shifted to the left digit (written as 1111 ),
