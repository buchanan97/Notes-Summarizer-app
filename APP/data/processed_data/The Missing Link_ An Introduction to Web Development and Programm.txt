username password populated query actually read follows select user pas evaluated malicious user automatically logged make logic statement true true true regardless half statement malicious user

sanitize validating sanitization remove actually desired input validation fail missing link introduction web development programming chapter mysql source risk data storing data mysql web page interface order build interactive experience store user credential database need consider fact website communicates database inherent weakness true database physical life operating site basic mechanism protecting site prevent unauthorized access achieved obfuscating user password store employ couple tactic called hashing salting hashing process passing password mathematical algorithm turn password longer string character algorithm designed meaning hash passed algorithm reveals original text algorithm produce hash time given password occasionally duplicate occur fault called hash collision result stored database place user s actual password time user log type original password authentication pass algorithm compare result stored value make sure match use hash ensures able gain access database simply copy credential use advantage stored value actual password use couple popular method used achieve discourage use hash comparatively shorter use today data gathered algorithm password hash just using site like issue relying original hashing algorithm site doing site using compromised attacker usernames password site user used odds probably using email address username password data attacker set usernames password try site using hashing mechanism credential used site work hashed value word password example return value value paste original text password given fear defend salt salting process adding extra user s password like adding salt food make better ensure user password site stored database different mean malicious person use encrypted password site salt user user s password hash password pas hash password try use known pas missing link introduction web development programming chapter word hash password work site use salt creating salt password using coded directly script mind using single salt value make sure running script user access like linked javascript value appear html hidden value form give missing key circumvent extra protection added having salt script malicious agent need gain access web server database especially script seg regated database s home storing unique salt password mean salt discovered account compromised compromised
